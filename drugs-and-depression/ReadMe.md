Depression is a pervasive issue that plagues the United States. We chose to explore the relationship and
understand the impact that factors like alcohol and drug consumption have on depression tendencies on
different groups. In order to explore depression as a function of substance abuse, we took NHANES
datasets that combined substance abuse and depressive factors. Our research revealed some
statistically significant correlations could be drawn between marijuana and depression levels. However,
our research fails to draw correlations between other drugs and alcohol with depression. Nevertheless,
we provide our insights into how one might improve our models. The importance of our research
outlines potential causes for depression, which can provide people with insights to make better
decisions, and furthermore could inform policy discussions about healthy consumption patterns.
