The 19th-century scholar Georg Wissowa[18] thought that the Romans distinguished two classes of gods, the di indigetes and the di novensides or novensiles: the indigetes were the original gods of the Roman state, their names and nature indicated by the titles of the earliest priests and by the fixed festivals of the calendar, with 30 such gods honored by special festivals; the novensides were later divinities whose cults were introduced to the city in the historical period, usually at a known date and in response to a specific crisis or felt need. Arnaldo Momigliano and others, however, have argued that this distinction cannot be maintained.

"Indeed,
most of the state constitutions already made the tenure of the principal
judges dependent upon their good behavior, though in some cases judges
were removable, as in England, upon the joint address of the two Houses
of the Legislature. That the Federal judges should be similarly
removable by the President upon the application of the Senate and House
of Representatives was proposed late in the Convention by Dickinson of
Delaware, but the suggestion received the vote of only one State. so most of the land constitutions
395 Miller Manors
Batesburgh, HI 75450
 already made the term of office of the star pass judgment pendant upon their good behavior though in some typeface pass judgment were obliterable as in england upon the stick speech of the deuce home of the legislature. But, while the Convention was in accord on this matter, another
question, that of the organization of the new judiciary, evoked the
sharpest disagreement among its members. All believed that there must be
a national Supreme Court to impress upon the national statutes a
construction that should be uniformly binding throughout the country;
but they disagreed upon the question whether there should be inferior
national courts. Rutledge of South Carolina wanted the state courts to
be used as national courts of the first instance and argued that a right
of appeal to the supreme national tribunal would be quite sufficient ""to
secure the national rights and uniformity of judgment."" But Madison
pointed out that such an arrangement would cause appeals to be
multiplied most oppressively and that, furthermore, it would provide no
remedy for improper verdicts resulting from local prejudices. A
compromise was reached by leaving the question to the discretion of
Congress. The champions of local liberties, however, both at
Philadelphia and in the state conventions continued to the end to urge
that Congress should utilize the state courts as national tribunals of
the first instance. The significance of this plea should be emphasized
because the time was to come when the same interest would argue that for
the Supreme Court to take appeals from the state courts on any account
was a humiliation to the latter and an utter disparagement of

"important than the of supreme to the judicial systems of the states was question of its relation the constitution as governing instrument. Though the idea that courts were
entitled to pronounce on the constitutionality of legislative acts had
received countenance in a few dicta in some of the States and perhaps in
one or two decisions, this idea was still at best in 1787 but the germ
of a possible institution. even more systems than the relation relation the supreme court to the judicial important of the states was the question of its of to the constitution as a governing instrument. By the sixth resolution of this plan the national

its opinion, contravened ""the Articles of Union, or any treaty

associated with the Executive, ""with authority to examine every act of
the national legislature before it shall operate, and every act of a
particular legislature before a negative thereon shall be final"" and to
impose a qualified veto in either case. But, as discussion in the Convention proceeded, three principles
obtained clearer and clearer recognition, if not from all its members,
certainly from the great majority of them: first, that the Constitution
is law, in the sense of being enforcible by courts; secondly, that it is
supreme law, with which ordinary legislation must be in harmony to be
valid; and thirdly--a principle deducible from the doctrine of the
separation of powers--that, while the function of making new law belongs
to the legislative branch of the Government, that of expounding the
standing law, of which the Constitution would be part and parcel,
belongs to the Judiciary. even more crucial than the coition of the supreme motor inn to the juridical system of rules of the commonwealth was the question of its coition to the fundamental law as a regularise instrumental role. the more important than the relation of instrument supreme was to the judicial systems of the states court the question of its relation to the constitution as a governing even.

and, with some slight changes, became Article VIII of the report of the
Committee of Detail of the 7th of August, which in turn became ""the
linch-pin of the Constitution."" even more important than the relation the supreme court to the judicial systems of the states was the question of its relation to the constitution governing. The foundation was thus laid for the Supreme Court

circuit to pass upon pension claims, their determinations to be
reviewable by the Secretary of the Treasury. In protests which they
filed with the President, the judges stated the dilemma which confronted

Marshall's Early Years

John Marshall was born on September 24, 1755, in Fauquier County,
Virginia. Though like Jefferson he was descended on his mother's side
from the Randolphs of Turkey Island, colonial grandees who were also
progenitors of John Randolph, Edmund Randolph, and Robert E. Lee, his
father, Thomas Marshall, was ""a planter of narrow fortune"" and modest
lineage and a pioneer. chapter ii marshalls early years john was born on september in fauquier virginia. The external furnishings of the boy's
8557 Robert Wall Apt. 733

 life were
extremely primitive, a fact which Marshall used later to recall by
relating that his mother and sisters used thorns for buttons and that
hot mush flavored with balm leaf was regarded as a very special dish. Neighbors of course, were few and far between, but society was not
lacking for all that. chapter ii follow george catlett marshall marshalls early years john marshall was born on september in fauquier county george catlett marshall virginia. Among the various influences which, during the plastic years of boyhood
and youth, went to shape the outlook of the future Chief Justice high
rank must be accorded his pioneer life. It is not merely that the spirit
of the frontier, with its independence of precedent and its audacity of
initiative, breathes through his great constitutional decisions, but
also that in being of the frontier Marshall escaped being something
else. Had he been born in lowland Virginia, he would have imbibed the
intense localism and individualism of the great plantation, and with his
turn of mind might well have filled the rôle of Calhoun instead of that
very different rôle he actually did fill. There was, indeed, one great
planter with whom young Marshall was thrown into occasional contact, and
that was his father's patron and patron saint, Washington."|('8557 Robert Wall Apt. 733\nLake Kellyburgh, MS 40592',)

 native of Ireland, a man of letters,
who fled from the storms of his own country to find quiet in ours....
Possessing himself of a beautiful island in the Ohio he rears upon it a
palace and decorates it with every romantic embellishment of fancy. [Then] in the midst of all this peace, this innocent simplicity, this
pure banquet of the heart, the destroyer comes ... to change this
paradise into a hell.... By degrees he infuses [into the heart of
Blennerhassett] the poison of his own ambition.... In a short time the
whole man is changed, and every object of his former delight is
relinquished.... His books are abandoned.... His enchanted island is
destined soon to relapse into a wilderness; and in a few months we find
the beautiful and tender partner of his bosom, whom he lately 'permitted
not the winds of summer to visit too roughly,' we find her shivering at
midnight on the winter banks of the Ohio and mingling her tears with the
torrents that froze as they fell. the raised by this argument was the comparatively one whether constitutional provision regarding treason was to be interpreted in the the common law doctrine that in treason are. Sir, neither the human heart nor the human understanding will bear a

contemporaries as the ""Steamboat case,"" Marshall received the
opportunity to apply his principles of constitutional construction to
the power of Congress to regulate ""commerce among the States."" For a
quarter of a century Robert R. Livingston and Robert Fulton and their
successors had enjoyed from the Legislature of New York a grant of the
exclusive right to run steamboats on the waters of the State, and in
this case one of their licensees, Ogden, was seeking to prevent Gibbons,
who had steamers in the coasting trade under an Act of Congress, from
operating them on the Hudson in trade between points in New York and New
Jersey. the question is in truth take a leak a question of supremacy and if torah the right of the states to tax the means employed by the general connect government be conceded utilise the taxation declaration that the constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof shall torah gaffer be supreme law of the land is hoosier state empty and unmeaning declamation follow we are commonwealth unanimously of opinion concluded the chief justice that the utilise law of maryland imposing past a follow tax on the bank of the united states follow is confess unconstitutional and void. the query is in truth a query of mastery and if the right of the state of matter to tax the think of hire by the general government activity be conceded the contract that the constitution and the police force bring in in pursuit therefrom shall be sovereign police force of the commonwealth is empty bellied and unmeaning declamation we are nem con of view all over the head judge that the police force of old line state inflict a tax on the deposit of the united state of matter is unconstitutional and void. ¹ 9 Wheaton, 1. the interrogate is in sojourner truth a interrogate of domination and if the veracious of the res publica to tax the means employ by the superior general regime be confess the declaration that the makeup and the law of nature draw in quest thereof shall be supreme law of the land is void and unmeaning declamation we are nem con of view over the chief doj that the law of md magisterial a tax on the bank building of the unite res publica is unconstitutional and quash. the question is in accuracy a question of mastery and if the right of the tell to taxation the think of employ by the worldwide authorities be profess the resolution that the establishment and the laws made in prosecution therefrom shall be sovereign police of the domain is empty and unmeaning declamation we are unanimously of vox populi reason the chief jurist that the police of md levy a taxation on the bank of the combine tell is unconstitutional and emptiness. Webster, never in any case apt to regard his own
performance overcritically, seems in later years to have been persuaded
that the Chief Justice's opinion ""followed closely the track"" of his
argument on this occasion; and it is true that Marshall expressed
sympathy with Webster's contention that Congress may regulate as truly
by inaction as by action, since inaction may indicate its wish that the
matter go unregulated; but the Chief Justice did not explicitly adopt
this idea, and the major part of his opinion was a running refutation of
Emmet's argument, which in turn was only an elaboration of Chancellor
Kent's opinion upon the same subject in the New York courts. ¹ In other
words, this was one of those cases in which Marshall's indebtedness to
counsel was far less for ideas than for the stimulation which his own
powers always received from discussion; and the result is his
profoundest, most statesmanlike opinion, from whose doctrines the Court
has at times deviated, but only to return to them, until today it is

bills of credit, make anything but gold and silver a legal tender in
payment of debts, pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law
impairing the obligation of contracts."" Until 1798, the provision
generally regarded as offering the most promising weapon against special
legislation was the ex post facto clause. In that year, however, in its
decision in Calder vs. Bull the Court held that this clause ""was not
inserted to secure the citizen in his private rights of either property
or contracts,"" but only against certain kinds of penal legislation. that the developed interpretation of the principle of the separation of powers and have enunciated of due process of law which renders legislative abuse impossible but in though the principle of the separation of powers had received verbal recognition in several of the state no one as yet precisely what term legislative power signified at that time review did not exist. since that day this courts have developed an interpretation of the principle of the separation of powers and have enunciated a theory the due process of law which renders the sort of legislative abuse quite impossible but in though power principle of of separation of powers had received the recognition several in constitutions the state of no one as yet knew precisely what verbal term legislative the signified and at that time judicial review did not exist.

¹ In connection with this paragraph, see
436 Alvarez Union
Nathanville, MT 04389
 the writer's article entitled
The Basic Doctrine of American Constitutional Law, in the Michigan Law
Review, February, 1914. Marshall once wrote Story regarding his attitude
toward Section X in 1787, as follows: ""The questions which were
perpetually recurring in the State legislatures and which brought
annually into doubt principles which I thought most sacred, which proved
that everything was afloat, and that we had no safe anchorage ground,
gave a high value in my estimation to that article of the Constitution
which imposes restrictions on the States."" Such was still the situation when the case of Fletcher vs. Peck ¹ in
1810 raised before the Supreme Court the question whether the Georgia
Legislature had the right to rescind a land grant made by a preceding
Legislature. On any of three grounds Marshall might easily have disposed
of this case before coming to the principal question. in connection with this basic see article writers the entitled the paragraph doctrine of american constitutional law in the michigan law review february. The Court would not today take jurisdiction of such a case, but Marshall
does not even suggest such a solution of the question, though Justice
Johnson does in his concurring opinion. In the second place, Georgia's
own claim to the lands had been most questionable, and consequently her
right to grant them to others was equally dubious; but this, too, is an
issue which Marshall avoids. Finally, the grant had been procured by
corrupt means, but Marshall ruled that this was not a subject the Court
might enter upon; and for the ordinary run of cases in which undue
influence is alleged to have induced the enactment of a law, the ruling
is clearly sound. But this was no ordinary case. in connection with this paragraph see the writers article entitled the title basic catch doctrine of american constitutional law in the michigan law clause review clause

treaty or under the Constitution itself, the highest state court into
which the case can come must either sustain such a claim or consent to
have its decision reviewed, and possibly reversed, by the Supreme Court. The defenders of State Rights at first applauded this arrangement
because it left to the local courts the privilege of sharing a
jurisdiction which could have been claimed exclusively by the Federal
Courts. But when State Rights began to grow into State Sovereignty, a
different attitude developed, and in 1814 the Virginia Court of Appeals,
in the case of Hunter vs. Martin, ² pronounced Section XXV void, though,
in order not to encourage the disloyal tendencies then rampant in New
England, the decision was not published until after the Treaty of Ghent,

Review, vol. For several years after this, hardly a session of Congress convened in

another, the enlargement of the Court from seven to ten judges; another,
the requirement that any decision setting aside a state law must have
the concurrence of five out of seven judges; another, the allowance of
appeals to the Court on decisions adverse to the constitutionality of
state laws as well as on decisions sustaining them. Finally, in January,

itself as ""placed above the control of the will of the people, in a
state of disconnection with them, inaccessible to the charities and
sympathies of human life."" The amendment failed, however, and in the end
the bill itself was rejected. Yet a proposition to swamp the Court which received the approval of

definition of national power, it is true, but he had made the Supreme
Court one of the great political forces of the country. The very
ferocity with which the pretensions of the Court were assailed in
certain quarters was indirect proof of its power, but there was also
direct testimony of a high order. In 1830 Alexis de Tocqueville, the
French statesman, visited the United States just as the rough frontier
democracy was coming into its own. yet there was matchless value in which the import of marshall achievement mustiness have been as clean cut to himself as it was to his generation. yet there was as respect in it the significance of marshalls achievement must have been as clear to himself one which was to his contemporaries. Without them the Constitution
would be a dead letter: the Executive appeals to them for assistance
against the encroachments of the legislative power; the Legislature
demands their protection against the assaults of the Executive; they
defend the Union from the disobedience of the States, the States from
the exaggerated claims of the Union, the public interest against private
interests and the conservative spirit of stability against the
fickleness of the democracy."" yet there was one respect in which the of must have been as clear to himself as it was to his contemporaries. yet was one respect in which the significance of marshalls must have been as clear to himself as it was to contemporaries. even there was one prize in which the signification of marshalls accomplishment moldiness have been as shed light on to himself as it was to his coevals."|('118 Hamilton View Suite 289\nNew Stephenstad, KY 42645',)
"The language
of the law thus becomes, in some measure, a vulgar tongue; the spirit of
law, which is produced in the schools and courts of justice, gradually
penetrates beyond their walls into the bosom of society, where it
descends to the lowest classes, so that at last the whole people
contract the habits and the tastes of the judicial magistrate."" In one respect, however, De Tocqueville erred. American ""legalism,"" that
curious infusion of politics with jurisprudence, that mutual
consultation of public opinion and established principles, which in the
past has so characterized the course of discussion and legislation in
America, is traceable to origins long antedating Marshall's chief
justiceship. On the other hand, there is no public career in American
history which ever built so largely upon this pervasive trait of the
national outlook as did Marshall's, or which has contributed so much to
render it effective in palpable institutions. CHAPTER VIII

Among Friends And Neighbors

It is a circumstance of no little importance that the founder of
American Constitutional
011 Tapia Square Apt. 642
South Tommyside, ID 03308
 Law was in tastes and habit of life a simple
countryman. To the establishment of National Supremacy and the Sanctity
of Contracts Marshall brought the support not only of his office and his
command of the art of judicial reasoning but also the whole-souled
democracy and unpretentiousness of the fields. And it must be borne in
mind that Marshall was on view before his contemporaries as a private
citizen rather more of the time, perhaps, than as Chief Justice. His
official career was, in truth, a somewhat leisurely one. Until 1827 the
term at Washington rarely lasted over six weeks and subsequently not
over ten weeks. In the course of his thirty-four years on the Bench, the
Court handed down opinions in over 1100 cases, which is probably about
four times the number of opinions now handed down at a single term; and
of this number Marshall spoke for the Court in about half the

In the brief period of twenty-seven months following the death of
Marshall the Supreme Court received a new Chief Justice and five new
Associate Justices. his in life was worthy of the exalted character he sustained private public station. his private character was worthy of the exalted life he sustained in public station. The first of these decisions gave what was designated

prohibition against ""bills of credit"" in deference to the same high
prerogative ²; the third curtailed the operation of the ""obligation of
contracts"" clause as a protection of public grants. ³ Story, voicing ""an
earnest desire to vindicate his [Marshall's] memory from the imputation
of rashness,"" filed passionate and unavailing dissents. With difficulty

Roman mythology is the body of traditional stories pertaining to ancient Rome's legendary origins and religious system, as represented in the literature and visual arts of the Romans. ""Roman mythology"" may also refer to the modern study of these representations, and to the subject matter as represented in the literature and art of other cultures in any period. The Romans usually treated their traditional narratives as historical, even when these have miraculous or supernatural elements. The stories are often concerned with politics and morality, and how an individual's personal integrity relates to his or her responsibility to the community or Roman state. Heroism was an important theme."|('147 Neal Glens\nSouth Stephanie, HI 73806',)
"When the stories illuminate Roman religious practices, they are more concerned with ritual, augury, and institutions than with theology or cosmogony. [1]

The study of Roman religion and myth is complicated by the early influence of Greek religion on the Italian peninsula during Rome's protohistory, and by the later artistic imitation of Greek literary models by Roman authors. In matters of theology, the Romans were curiously eager

 to identify their own gods with those of the Greeks (interpretatio graeca), and to reinterpret stories about Greek deities under the names of their Roman counterparts. [2] Rome's early myths and legends also

While Roman mythology may lack a body of divine narratives as extensive as that found in Greek literature,[3] Romulus and Remus suckling the she-wolf is as famous as any image from Greek mythology except for the Trojan Horse. [4] Because Latin literature was more widely known in Europe throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance, the interpretations of Greek myths by the Romans often had a greater influence on narrative and pictorial representations of ""classical mythology"" than Greek sources. when the stories illuminate roman religious and they are more with concerned ritual augury practices institutions than with theology or cosmogony. when the stories illuminate roman religious practices more are they concerned with than augury and institutions ritual with theology or cosmogony. when the stories illuminate roman religious practices they augury more concerned with ritual are and cosmogony than with theology or institutions. when the stories illuminate roman print religious pattern they are more occupy with rite augury and institutions than with divinity or

"The Establishment Of The National Judiciary

The monarch of ancient times mingled the functions of priest and judge. It is therefore not altogether surprising that even today a judicial
system should be stamped with a certain resemblance to an ecclesiastical
hierarchy. If the Church of the Middle Ages was ""an army encamped on the
soil of Christendom, with its outposts everywhere,

slew the soul,"" the same words, slightly varied, may be applied to the
Federal Judiciary created by the American Constitution. the establishment bore of the national judiciary the routine monarch of gauge ancient times mingled the functions of priest and judge. And if the voice of the Church was the voice of God, so the voice of the
Court is the voice of the American people as this is recorded in the
Constitution. The Hildebrand of American constitutionalism is John Marshall. the establishment of the national judiciary the monarch ancient times the of priest and judge. Both fought with
intellectual weapons. Both addressed their appeal to the minds and
hearts of men. Both died before the triumph of their respective causes
and amid circumstances of great discouragement."|('13989 Timothy Wells Suite 278\nBrittanymouth, IL 68878',)
"Both worked through and
for great institutions which preceded them and which have survived them. And, as the achievements of Hildebrand cannot be justly appreciated
without some knowledge of the ecclesiastical system which he did so much
to develop, neither can the career of John Marshall be understood
without some knowledge of
41485 Barry Station
South Thomastown, VA 30458
 the organization of the tribunal through which
he wrought and whose power he did so much to exalt. The first chapter in
the history of John Marshall and his influence upon the laws of the land
must therefore inevitably deal with the historical conditions underlying
the judicial system of which it is the capstone. The vital
329 Butler Groves Apt. 810
Dylanborough, AZ 01770
 defect of the system of government provided by the soon
obsolete Articles of Confederation lay in the fact that it operated not
upon the individual citizens of the United States but upon the States in
their corporate capacities. both function through and for peachy institutions which forego them and which have pull through them. Theoretically, perhaps,
Congress had the right to coerce the States to perform their duties; at
any rate, a Congressional Committee headed by Madison so decided at the
very moment (1781) when the Articles were going into effect. But
practically such a course of coercion, requiring in the end the exercise
of military power, was out of the question. Whence were to come the
forces for military operations against recalcitrant States? both worked through for institutions which preceded them and which them. The history of the German Empire has demonstrated
that the principle of state coercion is entirely feasible when a single
powerful State dominates the rest of the

pointed out that such an arrangement would cause appeals to be
multiplied most oppressively and that, furthermore, it would provide no
remedy for improper verdicts resulting from local prejudices. A
compromise was reached by leaving the question to the discretion of
Congress. The champions of local liberties, however, both at
Philadelphia and in the state conventions continued to the end to urge
that Congress should utilize the state courts as national tribunals of
the first instance. The significance of this plea should be emphasized
because the time was to come when the same interest would argue that for
the Supreme Court to take appeals from the state courts on any account

"yet more authoritative than the sexual congress of the sovereign margaret court to the juridical organisation of the res publica was the question of its sexual congress to the constitution as a governing tool. Though the idea that courts were
entitled to pronounce on the constitutionality of legislative acts had
received countenance in a few dicta in some of the States and perhaps in
one or two decisions, this idea was still at best in 1787 but the germ
of a possible institution. It is not surprising, therefore, that no such
doctrine found place in the resolutions of the Virginia plan which came
before the Convention. By the sixth resolution of this plan the national
legislature was to have the power of negativing all state laws which, in
its opinion, contravened ""the Articles of Union, or any treaty
subsisting under the authority of the Union,"" and by the eighth
resolution ""a convenient number of the national judiciary"" were to be
associated with the Executive, ""with authority to examine every act of
the national legislature before it shall operate, and every act of a
particular legislature before a negative thereon shall be final"" and to
impose a qualified veto in either case. But, as discussion in the Convention

chosen a member from Richmond: ""Mr. Chairman, I conceive that the object
of the discussion now before us is whether democracy or despotism be

much less conspicuous than that of either Madison or Randolph, but in
the second rank of the Constitution's defenders, including men like
Corbin, Nicholas, and Pendleton, he stood foremost. His remarks were
naturally shaped first of all to meet the immediate necessities of the
occasion, but now and then they foreshadow views of a more enduring
value. For example, he met a favorite contention of the opposition by
saying that arguments based on the assumption that necessary powers
would be abused were arguments against government in general and ""a
recommendation of anarchy."" To Henry's despairing cry that the proposed
system lacked checks, he replied: ""What has become of his enthusiastic

of his face, being relaxed, give him the appearance of a man of fifty
years of age, nor can he be much younger; his countenance has a faithful
expression of great good humour and hilarity; while his black eyes--that
unerring index--possess an irradiating spirit, which proclaims the
imperial powers of the mind that sits enthroned within. The ""British Spy"" then describes Marshall's personality as an orator at
the time when he was still practicing at the Virginia bar:

His voice [the description continues] is dry and hard; his attitude, in
his most effective orations, was often extremely awkward, as it was not
unusual for him to stand with his left foot in advance, while all his
gestures proceeded from his right arm, and consisted merely in a
vehement, perpendicular swing of it from about the elevation of his head
to the bar, behind which he was accustomed to stand.... [Nevertheless]
if eloquence may be said to consist in the power of seizing the
attention with irresistible force, and never permitting it to elude the
grasp until the hearer has received the conviction which the speaker
intends, [then] this extraordinary man, without the aid of fancy,
without the advantages of person, voice, attitude, gesture, or any of
the ornaments of an orator, deserves to be considered as one of the most
eloquent men in the world.... He possesses one original, and, almost,
supernatural faculty; the faculty of developing a subject by a single
glance of his mind, and detecting at once, the very point on which every
controversy depends. No matter what the question; though ten times more
knotty than the gnarled oak, the lightning of heaven is not more rapid
nor more resistless, than his astonishing penetration. Nor does the
exercise of it seem to cost him an effort. it appears in william person of letters of the british for the chief only of joints united states is in his wirts tall meager emaciated his muscles relaxed and elegance the so loosely connected as not justice to disqualify him apparently spy any vigorous exertion celebrated body but to destroy everything like his and harmony in his air and movements. it appears in william wirts celebrated letters of the british spy the chief justice of the united states is in his person tall meager emaciated his muscles relaxed and his joints so loosely connected as not only to disqualify him apparently for any vigorous exertion but to destroy everything like elegance and harmony in his air and movements.

him to look down and comprehend the whole ground at once, he determined
immediately and without difficulty, on which side the question might be

"in a bad cause his art consisted laying his premises so remotely from the point directly in debate else terms so and that the hearer no consequence which could be drawn from them was just admit them as but his premises once admitted the however followed as certainly as cogently as inevitably as in euclid. All his eloquence consists in the apparently deep self-conviction, and
emphatic earnestness of his manner, the correspondent simplicity and
energy of his style; the close and logical connexion of his thoughts;
and the easy gradations by which he opens his lights on the attentive
minds of his hearers. The audience are never permitted to pause for a moment. There is no
stopping to weave garlands of flowers, to hang in festoons, around a
favorite argument. On the contrary, every sentence is progressive; every
idea sheds new light on the subject; the listener is kept perpetually in
that sweetly pleasurable vibration, with which the mind of man always
receives new truths; the dawn advances in easy but unremitting pace; the
subject opens gradually on the view; until, rising in high relief, in
all its native colors and proportions, the argument is consummated by
the conviction of the delighted hearer. What appeared to Marshall's friends as most likely in his early middle
years to stand in the way of his advancement was his addiction to ease
and to a somewhat excessive conviviality. But it is worth noting that
the charge of conviviality was never repeated after he was appointed
Chief Justice; and as to his unstudious habits, therein perhaps lay one
of the causes contributing to his achievement. Both as attorney and as
judge, he preferred the quest of broad, underlying principles, and, with
plenty of time for recuperation from each exertion, he was able to bring
to each successive task undiminished vitality and unclouded attention. What the author of the Leviathan remarks of himself may well be repeated
of Marshall--that he made more use of his brains than of his bookshelves
and that, if he had read as much as most men, he would have been as
ignorant as they. That Marshall was one of the leading members of his profession in

about it which are today the interesting and instructive ones. Marshall,
reversing the usual order of procedure, left the question of
jurisdiction till the very last, and so created for himself an
opportunity to lecture the President on his duty to obey the law and to
deliver the commission. Marshall based his homily on the questionable
assumption that the President had not the power to remove Marbury from
office, for if he had this power the nondelivery of the document was of
course immaterial. Marshall's position was equally questionable when he
contended that the thirteenth section violated that clause of Article

beyond peradventure that the Common Law doctrine was grounded upon
unshakable authority; that, considering the fact that the entire
phraseology of the constitutional clause regarding treason comes from an
English statute of Edward III's time, it was reasonable, if not
indispensable, to construe it in the light of the Common Law; and that,
certainly as to a procurer of treason, such as Burr was charged with
being, the Common Law doctrine was the only just doctrine, being merely
a reaffirmation of the even more ancient principle that ""what one does
through another, he does himself."" In elaboration of this last point Wirt launched forth upon that famous
passage in which he contrasted Burr and the pathetic victim of his
conspiracy:

Who [he asked] is Blennerhassett? A native of Ireland, a man of letters,
who fled from the storms of his own country to find quiet in ours....
Possessing himself of a beautiful island in the Ohio he rears upon it a
palace and decorates it with every romantic embellishment of fancy. the legal question raised by this literary argument was the relatively simple minded one whether the constitutional provision view traitorousness was to be read in the calorie free of the commons law of nature doctrine that in traitorousness all are principal sum.

decided it on broad, general principles, but with the probable result
that it would never again have been heard of outside the law courts. To
take a timid or obscure way to a merely tentative goal would have been
at variance equally with Marshall's belief in his mission and with his
instincts as a great debater. Hence he forged his weapon--the obiter
dictum--by whose broad strokes was hewn the highroad of a national
destiny. Marshall's task naturally was not performed in vacuo: he owed much to
the preconceptions of his contemporaries. His invariable quest, as
students of his opinions are soon aware, was for the axiomatic, for
absolute principles, and in this inquiry he met the intellectual demands
of a period whose first minds still owned the sway of the syllogism and
still loved what Bacon called the ""spacious liberty of generalities."" In
Marshall's method--as in the older syllogistic logic, whose phraseology
begins to sound somewhat strange to twentieth century ears--the

""irrelevant"" elements from the ""significant"" facts of a case, and then
recognizing that this particular case had been foreseen and provided for

his most famous opinion. He condensed Pinkney's three-day argument into
a pamphlet which may be easily read by the instructed layman in half an
hour, for, as is invariably the case with Marshall, his condensation
made for greater clarity. In this opinion he also gives evidence, in
their highest form, of his other notable qualities as a judicial
stylist: his ""tiger instinct for the jugular vein""; his rigorous pursuit
of logical consequences; his power of stating a case, wherein he is
rivaled only by Mansfield; his scorn of the qualifying ""but's,"" ""if's,""

his early days with Pope; the developing momentum of his argument; above
all, his audacious use of the obiter dictum. Marshall's later opinion in

intellectual performance, but it does not equal this earlier opinion in

careful examination of a novel legal question of the first magnitude by
learned and acute minds, but some of the claims that have been made for
these arguments, and especially for Webster's effort, hardly sustain
investigation. Webster, never in any case apt to regard his own
performance overcritically, seems in later years to have been persuaded
that the Chief Justice's opinion ""followed closely the track"" of his
argument on this occasion; and it is true that Marshall expressed
sympathy with Webster's contention that Congress may regulate as truly
by inaction as by action, since inaction may indicate its wish that the
matter go unregulated; but the Chief Justice did not explicitly adopt
this idea, and the major part of his opinion was a running refutation of
Emmet's argument, which in turn was only an elaboration of Chancellor
Kent's opinion upon the same subject in the New York courts. ¹ In other
words, this was one of those cases in which Marshall's indebtedness to
counsel was far less for ideas than for the stimulation which his own
powers always received from discussion; and the result is his
profoundest, most statesmanlike opinion, from whose doctrines the Court

conferred the American character upon vessels already possessed of the
right to engage in the coasting trade; Marshall, on the contrary, held
that it conferred the right itself, together with the auxiliary right of
navigating the waters of the United States; whence it followed that New

For many years after the Revolution, the Trustees of Dartmouth College,

Congregationalism. Though this form of worship occupied almost the
position of a state religion in New Hampshire, early in this period
difficulties arose in the midst of the church at Hanover. A certain
Samuel Hayes, or Haze, told a woman named Rachel Murch that her
character was ""as black as Hell,"" and upon Rachel's complaint to the
session, he was ""churched"" for ""breach of the Ninth Commandment and also
for a violation of his covenant agreement."" This incident caused a rift
which gradually developed into something very like a schism in the local
congregation, and this internal disagreement finally produced a split
between Eleazar's son, Dr. John Wheelock, who was now president of
Dartmouth College, and the Trustees of the institution. The result was
that in August, 1815, the Trustees ousted Wheelock. in the clergyman eleazar wheelock of constitution state had shew at his own write down a polemonium van bruntiae cultivate for learn indians in the christian organized religion and so great was his succeeder that he felt bucked up to lead the undertaking and to solicit contribution in england. in the reverend eleazar wheelock of constitution state had install at his own expense a greek valerian school for teach amerindian language in the christian faith and so great was his achiever that he finger encouraged to protract the take in charge and to hook donation in

test case. In order to obtain the college seal, charter, and records, a

and his own inclination,"" he was to select his master from among the
children, ""that he may always be treated as a faithful meritorious
servant."" The Chief Justice's death evoked many eloquent tributes to his public
services and private excellencies, but none more just and appreciative
than that of the officers of court and members of the bar of his own
circuit who knew him most intimately. It reads as follows:

John Marshall, late Chief Justice of the United States, having departed
this life since the last Term of the Federal Circuit Court for this
district, the Bench, Bar, and Officers of the Court, assembled at the
present Term, embrace the first opportunity to express their profound
and heartfelt respect for the memory of the venerable judge, who
presided in this Court for thirty-five years--with such remarkable
diligence in office, that, until he was disabled by the disease which
removed him from life, he was never known to be absent from the bench,
during term time, even for a day,--with such indulgence to counsel and
suitors, that every body's convenience was consulted, but his own,--with
a dignity, sustained without

 effort, and, apparently, without care to
sustain it, to which all men were solicitous to pay due respect,--with
such profound sagacity, such quick penetration, such acuteness,
clearness, strength, and comprehension of mind, that in his hand, the
most complicated causes were plain, the weightiest and most difficult,
easy and light,--with such striking impartiality and justice, and a
judgment so sure, as to inspire universal confidence, so that few
appeals were ever taken from his decisions, during his long
administration of justice in the Court, and those only in cases where he
himself expressed doubt,--with such modesty, that he seemed wholly
unconscious of his own gigantic powers,--with such equanimity, such
benignity of temper, such amenity of manners, that not only none of the
judges, who sat with him on the bench, but no member of the bar, no
officer of the court, no juror, no witness, no suitor, in a single
instance, ever found or imagined, in any thing said or done, or omitted
by him, the slightest cause of

Epilogue

In the brief period of twenty-seven months following the death of
Marshall the Supreme Court received a new Chief Justice and five new
Associate Justices. The effect of this change in personnel upon the
doctrine of
16564 Decker Forge

 the Court soon became manifest. In the eleventh volume of
Peters's Reports, the first issued while Roger B. Taney was Chief
Justice, are three decisions of constitutional cases sustaining state
laws which on earlier argument Marshall had assessed as
unconstitutional. The first of these decisions gave what was designated
""the complete, unqualified, and exclusive"" power of the State to
regulate its ""internal police"" the right of way over the ""commerce
clause"" ¹; the second practically nullified the constitutional
prohibition against ""bills of credit"" in deference to the same high
prerogative ²; the third curtailed the operation of the ""obligation of
contracts"" clause as a protection of public grants. ³ Story, voicing ""an
earnest desire to vindicate his [Marshall's] memory from the imputation
of rashness,"" filed passionate and unavailing dissents. his private life was hold up worthy of the exalted character he sustained in public individual station. his buck private lifetime was worthy of the exalted role he hold up in public

¹ Notwithstanding what is said above, it is also true that the modern
doctrine of ""the police power"" owes something to Marshall's
interpretation of the ""necessary and proper"" clause in M'Culloch vs.
Maryland, which is frequently offered nowadays as stating the
authoritative definition of ""a fair legislative discretion"" in relation
to private rights. even so what is said above it is too true that the new ism of the police force power owes something to marshalls version of the necessary and right clause in mculloch vanadium old line state which is ofttimes offered now as stating the classical definition of a fairish

Markmouth, AZ 61308
 legislative discretion in relation to individual rectify. See Cowen (N. But it never
received his sanction and does not represent his point of view. And this difference in the point of view of the judiciary connotes a
general difference of outlook which makes itself felt today even in that
field where Marshall wrought most enduringly. The Constitution was
established under the sway of the idea of the balance of power, and with
the purpose of effecting a compromise among a variety of more or less
antagonistic interests, some of which were identified with the cause of
local autonomy, others of which coalesced with the cause of National
Supremacy. The Nation and the States were regarded as competitive
forces, and a condition of tension between them was thought to be not
only normal but desirable. notwithstanding what is said above it is besides true that the advanced philosophy of the law office owe something to marshal rendition of the requirement and right clause in mculloch vs maryland which is oft offered nowadays as stating the classical definition of a bonny legislative free will in relation to private rightfield. Local differences have to a great extent disappeared, and that general
interest which is the same for all the States is an ever deepening one. The idea of the competition of the States with the Nation is yielding to
that of their coöperation in public service. And it is much the same
with the relation of the three departments of

"An Eviction Notice, also known as a Notice to Quit, is a document sent by a Landlord to a Tenant to inform them of a violation or termination of the lease agreement and to start the process of removing a Tenant from the property. This process can be very technical and varies from state to state. However, this eviction process generally begins with the Landlord providing the Tenant with a written Eviction Notice. Acceptable reasons to evict a tenant range from issues such as nonpayment of rent, violation of the lease terms, engaging in illegal activities on the premises, ending a month to month lease, or a Tenant staying on the premises after the lease has been terminated. The Eviction Notice serves to make the Tenant aware that they have
5259 Nguyen Forges
North Adammouth, KY 23732
 not complied with the terms of the lease or are otherwise subject to being evicted and gives the Tenant a deadline by which they must either correct the issue or make arrangements to leave the property. If the Tenant does not cure the violation or leave the property, the Landlord can proceed with further legal action to reclaim the property according to the process dictated by relevant state law. How to use this document

Use this document to inform a Tenant that they have violated their lease or their lease agreement is otherwise being terminated prior to the Landlord filing an eviction action in court. This Notice includes important facts about the property and lease agreement, including the parties to the lease, address of the rental property, the date the Tenant entered into the lease agreement, a description of the reason why the Tenant is being evicted, and, if applicable, instructions about how the Tenant can cure the lease violation and the deadline by which they must take action to cure their violation and come in compliance with the lease. Once the Landlord has completed the Eviction Notice, it is generally accepted practice for them to sign and date it and make arrangements to provide the Tenant with the Notice, being sure to keep a copy of the Notice for their own files in case of future legal action. Generally, an Eviction Notice is sent by certified mail or delivered in person, so as to create a record that the letter was sent and received by the

"This record may be useful in case of future legal action, such as filing for eviction in court. All states require that a Tenant receive an eviction notice informing them of their eviction prior to the Landlord filing in court, so this record is essential to successfully completing the eviction process. Applicable law

As with all landlord/tenant law, the laws that dictate an Eviction Notice and the eviction procedure are highly

Lake Joshuaside, ME 75994
 state specific. Depending on the state, the Landlord is limited to a particular list of acceptable reasons to evict a Tenant. Further, depending on both the state and the reason for the eviction, Tenants have varying amounts of time to either cure the violation or make arrangements to leave the property prior to the Landlord instituting an eviction action in court. In states that have rent control laws, the process is further complicated if the property in question is rent controlled. To ensure that the Landlord is complying with state and local laws in beginning the eviction process, Landlords can get more information from their state or city housing bureau, municipal court, or local landlord or tenants union.

"At the end, you receive it in Word and PDF formats for free. You can modify it and reuse it. A landlord can't begin an eviction lawsuit without first legally terminating the tenancy. This means giving the tenant written

Guerrerobury, NV 28655
 notice, as specified in the state's termination statute. If the tenant doesn't move (or reform—for example, by paying the rent or finding a new home for the dog), you can then file a lawsuit to evict. (Technically, this is called an unlawful detainer, or UD, lawsuit.) Related Products

State laws set out detailed requirements to end a tenancy. Different types of termination notices are required for different types of situations, and each state has its own procedures as to how
USS Silva
FPO AP 56522
 termination notices and eviction papers must be written and delivered (""served""). When You Can Send Tenant a Notice for Termination With Cause

Although terminology varies somewhat from state to state, there are basically three types of termination notices for tenancies that landlords terminate due to tenant misbehavior:

    Pay Rent or Quit Notices, which landlords typically use when the tenant has not paid the rent. They give the tenant a few days (three to five in most states) to pay the rent or move out

Port Robert, ID 55052
 (""quit"")."|('82834 Emily Mission Suite 714\nGuerrerobury, NV 28655', 'USS Silva\nFPO AP 56522', '771 John Fork\nPort Robert, ID 55052')
"Cure or Quit Notices, which landlords typically give after a tenant violates a term or condition of the lease or rental agreement, such as a no-pets clause or the requirement to refrain from making excessive noise. Usually, the tenant has a set amount of time in which to correct, or ""cure,"" the violation. A tenant who fails to do so must move or face the possibility of an eviction lawsuit. Unconditional Quit Notices, which are the harshest of all. These order the tenant to vacate the premises with no chance to pay the rent or correct a lease or rental agreement violation. In most states, unconditional quit notices are allowed only when the tenant has:
        repeatedly violated a significant lease or rental agreement clause
        been late with the rent on more than one occasion
        seriously damaged the premises, or
        engaged in serious illegal activity, such as drug dealing on the premises. However, in some states, landlords are not required to give the tenant time in which to pay the overdue rent or fix a lease violation. In these states, landlords may use Unconditional Quit Notices for transgressions that would require Pay or Quit Notices or Cure or Quit Notices in other, more tenant-friendly states. In these states, landlords may extend second chances if they wish, but no law requires them to do so. Even after receiving notice, some tenants won't leave or fix the lease or rental agreement violation."|()
"If you still want the tenant to leave, you must begin an unlawful detainer lawsuit. This involves properly serving the tenant with a summons and complaint for eviction. When You Can Send Tenant a Notice for Termination Without Cause

Landlords may usually use a 30-Day or 60-Day Notice to Vacate to end a month-to-month tenancy when
993 Alfred Terrace Apt. 981
East Christophershire, ME 54200
 the tenant has not done anything wrong. Many rent control cities, however, do not allow this; they require the landlord to prove a legally recognized reason for eviction (""just cause"") of the tenants. When the tenant has a fixed-term lease, landlords typically cannot terminate the lease without just cause. Defenses to Eviction the Tenant Might Raise

If the tenant decides to mount a defense, it may add weeks—even months—to the eviction process. A tenant can point to mistakes in the notice or the eviction complaint, or improper service (delivery) of either, in an attempt to delay or dismiss the case. The way that you have conducted business with the tenant may also affect the outcome: If your rental unit is uninhabitable or the tenant thinks you are retaliating for things like repair requests, this may excuse or shift attention away from the tenant's wrongdoing and diminish your chances of victory. Removal of the Tenant After Winning Unlawful Detainer Suit

If you win the unlawful detainer lawsuit, you will get a judgment for possession of the property and/or for unpaid rent. But you can't just move the tenant and the tenant's possessions out onto the sidewalk—trying to remove a tenant yourself can cause a lot of

"(For more information, see Don't Lock Out or Freeze Out a Tenant—It's Illegal.) Be Careful When Removing Tenants' Abandoned Property

A few states allow landlords to freely dispose of property a tenant leaves behind after moving out. Even
194 Alejandro Mission Apt. 199
Laurabury, GA 95166
 in these states, this is legal only if it is quite clear that the tenant has left permanently, intending to turn the place over to the owner. In many states, landlords must follow storage and notification procedures. Typically, you must give the court judgment to a local law enforcement officer (sheriff or marshal), along with a fee that is charged to the tenant as part of your costs to bring suit. The sheriff or marshal gives the tenant a notice that the officer will be back within a number of days to physically remove the tenant if the tenant isn't gone by then. Rationale for the Rules About Evicting a Tenant

Landlords often chafe at the detailed rules that they must follow. There is a reason, however, why most states insist on strict compliance. First of all, an eviction case is, relatively speaking, a fast legal procedure. (How many other civil cases are over and done with after a few

"The price to pay for this streamlined treatment is unwavering adherence to the rules. Second, what's at stake here—a tenant's home—is arguably more important than a civil case concerning money or business. Consequently, legislators have been extra careful to see that tenants get adequate notice and an opportunity to respond. For

The Data Processing Terms (DPT) include the terms in this section. The Data Processing Terms also include the “Standard Contractual Clauses,” pursuant to the European Commission Decision of 5 February 2010 on standard contractual clauses for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries under the EU Data Protection Directive. The Standard Contractual Clauses are in Attachment 3. In addition,
•	Execution of the volume licensing agreement includes execution of Attachment 3, which is countersigned by Microsoft Corporation;
•	The terms in Customer’s volume licensing agreement, including the DPT, constitute a data processing agreement under which Microsoft is the data processor; and
•	The DPT control over any inconsistent or conflicting provision in Customer’s volume licensing agreement and, for each subscription, will remain in full force and effect until all of the related Customer Data is deleted from Microsoft’s systems in accordance with the DPT. Customer may opt out of the “Standard Contractual Clauses” or the Data Processing Terms in their

Attachment 3 – The Standard Contractual Clauses (Processors)
For the purposes of Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC for the transfer of personal data to processors established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection, Customer (as data exporter) and Microsoft Corporation (as data importer, whose signature appears below), each a “party,” together “the parties,” have agreed on the following Contractual Clauses (the “Clauses” or “Standard Contractual Clauses”) in order to adduce adequate safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals for the transfer by the data exporter to the data importer of the personal data specified in Appendix 1. Clause 1: Definitions

(a) 'personal data', 'special categories of data', 'process/processing', 'controller', 'processor', 'data subject' and 'supervisory authority' shall have the same meaning as in Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data;
(b) 'the data exporter' means the controller who transfers the personal data;
(c) 'the data importer' means the processor who agrees to receive from the data exporter personal data intended for processing on his behalf after the transfer in accordance with his instructions and the terms of the Clauses and who is not subject to a third country's system ensuring adequate protection within the meaning of Article 25(1) of Directive 95/46/EC;
(d) 'the subprocessor' means any processor engaged by the data importer or by any other subprocessor of the data importer who agrees to receive from the data importer or from any other subprocessor of the data importer personal data exclusively intended for processing activities to be carried out on behalf of the data exporter after the transfer in accordance with his instructions, the terms of the Clauses and the terms of the written subcontract;
(e) 'the applicable data protection law' means the legislation protecting the fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals and, in particular, their right to privacy with respect to the processing of personal data applicable to a data controller in the Member State in which the data exporter is established;

"Clause 3: Third-party beneficiary clause

1. The data subject can enforce against the data exporter this Clause, Clause 4(b) to (i), Clause 5(a) to (e), and (g) to (j), Clause 6(1) and (2), Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12 as third-party beneficiary. The data subject can enforce against the data importer this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where the data exporter has factually disappeared or has ceased to exist in law unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law, as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. The data subject can enforce against the subprocessor this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause 6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by operation of law as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. Such third-party liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. The parties do not object to a data subject being represented by an association or other body if the data subject so expressly wishes and if permitted by national law. Clause 4: Obligations of the data exporter

The data exporter agrees and warrants:

(a) that the processing, including the transfer itself, of the personal data has been and will continue to be carried out in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable data protection law (and, where applicable, has been notified to the relevant authorities of the Member State where the data exporter is established) and does not violate the relevant provisions of that State;
(b) that it has instructed and throughout the duration of the personal data processing services will instruct the data importer to process the personal data transferred only on the data exporter's behalf and in accordance with the applicable data protection law and the Clauses;
(c) that the data importer will provide sufficient guarantees in respect of the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 below;
(d) that after assessment of the

Barbermouth, AL 14537
 requirements of the applicable data protection law, the security measures are appropriate to protect personal data against accidental or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access, in particular where the processing involves the transmission of data over a network, and against all other unlawful forms of processing, and that these measures ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks presented by the processing and the nature of the data to be protected having regard to the state of the art and the cost of their implementation;
(e) that it will ensure compliance with the security measures;
(f) that, if the transfer involves special categories of data, the data subject has been informed or will be informed before, or as soon as possible after, the transfer that its data could be transmitted to a third country not providing adequate protection within the meaning of Directive 95/46/EC;
(g) to forward any notification received from the data importer or any subprocessor pursuant to Clause 5(b) and Clause 8(3) to the data protection supervisory authority if the data exporter decides to continue the transfer or to lift the suspension;
(h) to make available to the data subjects upon request a copy of the Clauses, with the exception of Appendix 2, and a summary description of the security measures, as well as a copy of any contract for subprocessing services which has to be made in accordance with the Clauses, unless the Clauses or the contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information;
(i) that, in the event of subprocessing, the processing activity is carried out in accordance with Clause 11 by a subprocessor providing at least the same level of protection for the personal data and the rights of data subject as the data importer under the Clauses; and
(j) that it will ensure compliance with Clause 4(a) to (i). Clause 5: Obligations of the data importer

The data importer agrees and warrants:

(a) to process the personal data only on behalf of the data exporter and in compliance with its instructions and the Clauses; if it cannot provide such compliance for whatever reasons, it agrees to inform promptly the data exporter of its inability to comply, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;
(b) that it has no reason to believe that the legislation applicable to it prevents it from fulfilling the instructions received from the data exporter and its obligations under the contract and that in the event of a change in this legislation which is likely to have a substantial adverse effect on the warranties and obligations provided by the Clauses, it will promptly notify the change to the data exporter as soon as it is aware, in which case the data exporter is entitled to suspend the transfer of data and/or terminate the contract;
(c) that it has implemented the technical and organisational security measures specified in Appendix 2 before processing the personal data transferred;
(d) that it will promptly notify the data exporter about:
(i) any legally binding request for disclosure of the personal data by a law enforcement authority unless otherwise prohibited, such as a prohibition under criminal law to preserve the confidentiality of a law enforcement investigation,
(ii) any accidental or unauthorised access, and
(iii) any request received directly from the data subjects without responding to that request, unless it has been otherwise authorised to do so;
(e) to deal promptly and properly with all inquiries from the data exporter relating to its processing of the personal data subject to the transfer and to abide by the advice of the supervisory authority with regard to the processing of the data transferred;
(f) at the request of the data exporter to submit its data processing facilities for audit of the processing activities covered by the Clauses which shall be carried out by the data exporter or an inspection body composed of independent members and in possession of the required professional qualifications bound by a duty of confidentiality, selected by the data exporter, where applicable, in agreement with the supervisory authority;
(g) to make available to the data subject upon request a copy of the Clauses, or any existing contract for subprocessing, unless the Clauses or contract contain commercial information, in which case it may remove such commercial information, with the exception of Appendix 2 which shall be replaced by a summary description of the security measures in those cases where the data subject is unable to obtain a copy from the data exporter;
(h) that, in the event of subprocessing, it has previously informed the data exporter and obtained its prior written consent;
(i) that the processing services by the subprocessor will be carried out in accordance with Clause 11; and
(j) to send promptly a copy of any subprocessor agreement it concludes under the Clauses to the data exporter. Clause 6: Liability

1. The parties agree that any data subject who has suffered damage as a result of any breach of the obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 by any party or subprocessor is entitled to receive compensation from the data exporter for the damage

 Clause 11, because the data exporter has factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent, the data importer agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data importer as if it were the data exporter, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract of by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The data importer may not rely on a breach by a subprocessor of its obligations in order to avoid its own liabilities. If a data subject is not able to bring a claim against the data exporter or the data importer referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2, arising out of a breach by the subprocessor of any of their obligations referred to in Clause 3 or in Clause 11 because both the data exporter and the data importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, the subprocessor agrees that the data subject may issue a claim against the data subprocessor with regard to its own processing operations under the Clauses as if it were the data exporter or the data importer, unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data importer by contract or by operation of law, in which case the data subject can enforce its rights against such entity. The liability of the subprocessor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses. Clause 7: Mediation and jurisdiction

1. The data importer agrees that if the data subject invokes against it third-party beneficiary rights and/or claims compensation for damages under the Clauses, the data importer will accept the decision of the data subject:
(a) to refer the dispute to mediation, by an independent person or, where applicable, by the supervisory authority;
(b) to refer the dispute to the courts in the Member State in which the data exporter is established. The parties agree that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice its substantive or procedural rights to seek remedies in accordance with other provisions of national or international law. Clause 8: Cooperation with supervisory authorities

1. The data exporter agrees to deposit a copy of this contract with the supervisory authority if it so requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law. The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data importer, and of any subprocessor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection

An escalation of rents and scarcity of housing supply have made it difficult for many Washingtonians to obtain stable housing, especially if they lose housing after experiencing an extraordinary life event that temporarily leaves them without resources and income. It is the long-standing practice of the state to make rental assistance available in many such urgent situations, and it is the intent of the legislature to provide a payment on the tenant's behalf to the landlord in certain eviction proceedings to give the tenant additional time to access resources that allow the tenants to stay in their home.""

who uses this reason must clearly state the facts supporting the allegation, and must send a copy of the
termination of tenancy notice to the SDCI Property
Owner Tenant Assistance (POTA) Unit. The owner wishes to occupy the premises personally, or the owner’s immediate family will occupy the

partner. SDCI may require a property owner to sign
a certification of the intent to have a family member
move in if a tenant has reason to believe the owner
will not follow through with this reason. It is a violation if the designated person does not occupy the
unit for a continuous period of 60 days out of the
90 days after the tenant vacates. A tenant whose
tenancy is ended for this reason has a private right
of action if he or she feels the owner has failed to

"DEFINITION OF HOUSING COSTS
Housing costs include rent and any other periodic
or monthly fees such as storage, parking, or utilities,
paid to the landlord by a tenant. INCREASE IN HOUSING COSTS
In the City of Seattle, a landlord must give a tenant 30
days’ advance written notice of an increase in housing
costs (rent, parking, storage, and other fees associated with the rental) of less than 10%; 60 days’ notice
is required for increases of 10% or more. An increase
can only begin at the beginning of rental period, typically at the beginning of the month. These notices
must include information about how the tenant
can access information about their rights and
responsibilities
A landlord cannot increase housing costs for any
housing unit that does not meet the minimum habitability standards of the Residential Rental Inspection
Program. (http://www.seattle.gov/dpd/cs/groups/pan/@
pan/documents/web_informational/s048492.pdf)
Property owners and developers cannot increase
housing costs to avoid applying for a Tenant Relocation License where a rental property is going to be
demolished, rehabilitated, changed in use, or where
use restrictions are going to be removed. (http://www. seattle.gov/dpd/codesrules/commonquestions/tenantrelocation/default.htm)

Rent Increases
The City of Seattle does not regulate or control rent. However, the Rental Agreement Regulation Ordinance
does require a landlord to provide at least sixty (60)
days’ advance written notice of any increase in housing costs of 10% or more in a twelve (12) month period; increases of less than 10% require an advance
written notice of at least thirty (30) days consistent
with state law. These notices must include information on how the tenant can access information on the
tenant’s rights and responsibilities. Housing costs
include rent, parking and storage fees, and other
periodic fees associated with a tenancy. Failure to
provide a required sixty (60) day notice is a violation

 Provisions
Month-to-month rental agreements, whether verbal
or in writing, cannot require a tenant to stay beyond
the initial period of the agreement. A landlord cannot
withhold a deposit or impose other penalties solely
on the basis that a tenant moves out at the end of the
initial rental period. However, a tenant who desires to terminate a monthto-month tenancy must provide the landlord with a
written notice at least twenty (20) days in advance of
the end of a rental period. Landlords are not obligated to pro-rate rent when a tenant moves out after the
beginning of a rental period. Security Deposits
If a landlord wishes to collect a security deposit, the
deposit and its amount must be identified in a written rental

Ordinances
When a residential building is being converted to
condominium or cooperative units, the Condominium
and Cooperative Conversion ordinances require a
housing code inspection. Additionally, in a condominium conversion, a tenant
must receive a written 120-day notice of the conversion. If the tenant decides not to buy his or her unit,
the tenant may be eligible to receive the equivalent
of three (3) months' rent in relocation assistance if the
tenant's annual income, from all sources, does not exceed 80 percent of the area median income, adjusted
for household size. A household which otherwise
qualifies to receive relocation benefits and which includes a member sixty-five (65) years of age or older
or an individual with ""special needs,"" as defined in the
ordinance, may qualify for additional assistance. In a cooperative conversion, a tenant must receive
a 120-day notice of intention to sell the unit. If the
tenant decides not to buy his or her unit, the tenant
must be paid $500.00 in relocation assistance. Relocation assistance is paid directly to the tenant
by the property owner or developer."|('6426 Hensley Landing\nNew Stephanie, ID 84830', '773 Conner Mill\nLake Daisyshire, MO 65798')

exceed 50% of the area median income, receive cash
relocation assistance. It is a violation of this ordinance
to increase housing costs for the purpose of avoiding
applying for a Tenant Relocation License. Call SDCI

discuss the dispute within 30 days of receiving notice
of the dispute. A tenant can also file a complaint with

from the law. Residents who are generally not covered by the Act are:
• Renters of

"RIGHTS OF ALL TENANTS
Regardless of whether they are covered by the Residential Landlord-Tenant Act, all renters have these
basic rights under other state laws: the Right to a
livable dwelling; Protection from
4263 Mary Extensions Suite 860
Lake Glennside, WV 84328
 unlawful discrimination; Right to hold the landlord liable for personal
injury or property damage caused by the landlord’s
negligence; Protection against lockouts and seizure of
personal property by the landlord. TYPES OF RENTAL AGREEMENTS
Month-to-Month Agreement. This agreement is for
an indefinite period of time, with rent usually payable
on a monthly basis or other short term period. The
agreement itself can be in writing or oral, but if any
type of fee or refundable deposit is collected, the
agreement must be in writing. [RCW 59.18.260]
A month-to-month agreement continues until the tenant gives the landlord written notice at least 20 days
before the end of the rental

 period. In the situation
of a conversion to a condominium or a change in the
policy excluding children the landlord must provide
90 days written notice to the tenant. [RCW 59.18.200]
The rent can be increased or the rules changed at any
time, provided the landlord gives the tenant written
notice at least 30 days before the effective date of the
rent increase or rule change. [RCW 59.18.140]
Fixed Term Lease. A lease requires the tenant to stay
for a specific amount of time and restricts the landlord’s
ability to change the terms of the rental agreement. A
lease must be in writing to be

custody of children), or national

the Washington State Human Rights Commission. You
may also file a complaint with the federal Fair Housing
Section of the Department of Housing and Urban Development or your local city human rights department. LIABILITY
Once a tenant has signed a rental agreement, the tenant must continue to pay the rent to maintain eligibility to bring actions under this act. The tenant should
also understand what he or she is responsible for in
the maintenance of the property. While the landlord is
responsible for any damage which occurs due to the
landlord's negligence, the tenant must be prepared to
accept responsibility for damages he or she

ILLEGAL PROVISIONS IN RENTAL
AGREEMENTS
Some provisions which may appear in rental agreements or leases are not legal and cannot be enforced
under the law. [RCW 59.18.230] These include:
• A provision which waives any right given to tenants

Lake Alexandrahaven, AR 31665
 by the Landlord-Tenant Act or that surrenders tenants’ right to defend themselves in court
against a landlord’s accusations. • A provision stating the tenant will pay the landlord’s attorney’s fees under any circumstances if a
dispute goes to court. • A provision which limits the landlord’s liability in
situations where the landlord would normally be
responsible. • A provision which requires the tenant to agree to a
particular arbitrator at the time of signing the
rental

 agreement. • A provision allowing the landlord to enter the
rental unit without proper notice. • A provision requiring a tenant to pay for all damage to the unit, even if it is not caused by tenants
or their guests. • A provision that allows the landlord to seize a tenant’s property if the tenant falls behind in rent. PRIVACY—LANDLORD’S ACCESS TO THE
RENTAL [RCW 59.18.150]
The landlord must give the tenant at least a two day
written notice of their intent to enter at reasonable
times. However, tenants must not unreasonably
refuse to allow the landlord to enter the rental where
the landlord has given at least one-day’s notice of
intent to enter at a specified time to exhibit the dwelling to prospective or actual purchasers or

"The law says that tenants shall not unreasonably
refuse the landlord access to repair, improve, or
service the dwelling. In case of an emergency, or if
the property has been abandoned, the landlord can
enter without notice. DEPOSITS AND OTHER FEES
Refundable deposits
Under the Landlord-Tenant Act, the term “deposit”
can only be applied to money which can be refunded
to the tenant. If a refundable deposit is collected, the
law requires:
• The rental agreement must be in writing. It must say
what each deposit is for and what the tenant must
do in order to get the money back. [RCW 59.18.260]
• The tenant must be given a written receipt for
each deposit. [RCW 59.18.270]
• A checklist or statement describing the condition
of the rental unit must be filled out. The landlord
and the tenant must sign it, and the tenant must
be given a signed copy. [RCW 59.18.260]
• The deposits must be placed in a trust account in
a bank or escrow company. The tenant must be
informed in writing where the deposits are

 being
kept."|('5745 Clarence Wells Suite 430\nHoustonview, RI 53052',)
"Unless some other agreement has been
made in writing, any interest earned by the deposit belongs to the landlord. [RCW 59.18.270]
Non-refundable fees
These will not be returned to the tenant under any circumstances. If a non-refundable fee is being charged,
the rental agreement must be in writing and must state
that the fee will not be returned. A non-refundable fee
cannot legally be called a “deposit.” [RCW 59.18.285]
LANDLORD’S RESPONSIBILITIES
[RCW 59.18.060]
The landlord must:
• Maintain the dwelling so it does not violate state
and local codes in ways which endanger tenants’
health and safety
• Maintain structural components, such as roofs,
floors and chimneys, in reasonably good repair. • Maintain the dwelling in reasonably weather tight
condition
• Provide reasonably adequate locks and keys. • Provide the necessary facilities to supply heat,
electricity, hot and cold water
• Provide garbage cans and arrange for removal of
garbage, except in single family dwellings
• Keep common areas, such as lobbies, stairways

systems
• Not intentionally or carelessly damage the dwelling
• Not permit “waste” (substantial damage to the
property) or “nuisance” (substantial interference
with other tenant’s use of property)
• Maintain smoke and carbon monoxide detection
devices including battery replacement
• Not engage in activity at the premises that is
imminently hazardous to the physical safety of
other persons on the premises and that entails a
physical assault on a person or unlawful use of
a firearm or other deadly weapon resulting in an
arrest [RCW 59.18.352]
• When moving out, restore the dwelling to the
same conditions as when the tenant moved in,
except for normal wear and tear
THREATENING BEHAVIOR BY A TENANT OR
LANDLORD (RCW 59.18.352 and 354)
If one tenant threatens another with a firearm or other
deadly weapon, and the threatening tenant is arrested
as a result of the threat, the landlord may terminate
the tenancy of the offending tenant (although the
landlord is not required to take such action). If the
landlord does not file an unlawful detainer action, the
threatened tenant may choose to give written notice
and move without further obligation under the rental
agreement. If a landlord threatens a tenant under
similar circumstances, the tenant may choose to give
notice and move. In both cases, the threatened tenant does not have to pay rent for any day following the
date of leaving, and is entitled to receive a pro-rated
refund of any prepaid rent. MAKING CHANGES TO THE MONTH-TOMONTH AGREEMENT
Generally speaking, if the landlord wants to change
the provisions of a month-to-month rental agreement,
such as raising the rent or changing rules, the tenant must be given at least 30 days notice in
521 Donald Rue
Leachfurt, MT 24751
 writing."|('521 Donald Rue\nLeachfurt, MT 24751',)
"These changes can only become effective at the
beginning of a rental period (the day the rent is due). Notice which is less than 30 days will be effective for
the following rental period. If the landlord wishes to convert the unit to a condominium, the tenant must be given a 120-day notice. [RCW 59.18.200]

approved by the Department of Health about the
health hazards of indoor mold, including how to

to the original owner must be transferred to the new
owner, who must put them in a trust or escrow
account. The new owner must promptly notify tenants

"[RCW 59.18.080]
Required Notice [RCW 59.18.070] When something
in the rental unit needs to be repaired, the first step is
for the tenant to give written notice
503 Pittman Trace
Lake Elizabeth, CT 95698
 of the problem to
the landlord or person who collects the rent. The notice must include the address and apartment
number of the rental; the name of the owner, if known;
and a description of the problem. After giving notice,
the tenant must wait the required time for the landlord
to begin making repairs. Those required waiting times
are: 24 hours for no hot or cold water, heat or electricity, or for a condition which is imminently hazardous to
life; 72 hours for repair of refrigerator, range and oven,
or a major plumbing fixture supplied by landlord; 10
days for all other repairs. Tenant’s Options [RCW 59.18.090] If repairs are not
started within the required time and if the tenant is paid
up in rent and utilities, the following options can be used:
1) Tenant can give written notice to the landlord
and move out immediately. Tenants are entitled
to a pro-rated refund of their rent, as well as the
deposits they would normally get back. 2) Litigation or arbitration can be used to work out
the dispute. 3) The tenant can hire someone to make the repairs. In
many cases the tenant can have the work done and
then deduct the cost from the rent. [RCW 59.18.100]
(This procedure cannot be used to force a landlord
to provide adequate garbage cans.)"|('503 Pittman Trace\nLake Elizabeth, CT 95698',)
"An Important Note: If the repair is one that has a
10-day waiting period, the tenant cannot contract
to have the work done until 10 days after the landlord receives notice, or five days after the landlord
receives the estimate, whichever is later. To follow this procedure a tenant must: Submit a
good
53869 Barry Village Apt. 096
Lake Beverlymouth, UT 29959
 faith estimate from a licensed or registered
tradesperson, if one is required, to the landlord. After the waiting period, the tenant can contract
with the lowest bidder to have the work done. After the work is completed, the tenant pays the
tradesperson and deducts the cost from the rent
payment. The landlord must be given the opportunity to inspect the work. The cost of each repair
cannot exceed one month’s rent; total cost cannot
exceed two month’s rent in any 12-month period. If a large repair which affects a number of tenants
needs to be made, the tenants can join together,
follow the proper procedure, and have the work
done. Then each can deduct a portion of the cost
from their rent. 4) The tenant can make the repairs and deduct the
cost from the rent, if the work does not require a
licensed or registered tradesperson. The same
procedure is followed as for (2)

"However,
the cost limit is one half of one month’s rent. 5) Rent in Escrow - After notice of defective conditions, and after appropriate government certification of defect, and waiting periods have passed,
then tenants may place their monthly rent payments in an escrow account. It is wise to consult
an attorney before taking this action. ILLEGAL LANDLORD ACTIONS
Lockouts. [RCW 59.18.290] The law prohibits
landlords from changing locks, adding new locks, or
otherwise making it impossible for the tenant to use
the normal locks and keys. Even if a tenant is behind
in rent, such lockouts are illegal. A tenant who is locked out can file a lawsuit to
regain entry. Some local governments also have laws
against lockouts and can help a tenant who has been
locked out of a rental. For more information contact
your city or county government. [RCW 59.18.300] The landlord may not
shut off utilities because the tenant is behind in rent, or to
force a tenant to move

 out."|('PSC 0548, Box 9837\nAPO AE 27819',)

by the landlord so that repairs may be made, and only
for a reasonable amount of time. If a landlord intentionally does not pay utility bills so the service will be turned
off, that could
699 Stacey River Apt. 718
New Brettberg, NM 41003
 be considered an illegal shutoff. If the utilities have been shut off by the landlord, the tenant should
first check with the utility company to see if it will restore
service. If it appears the shutoff is illegal, the tenant can
file a lawsuit. If the tenant wins in court, the judge can
award the tenant up to $100 per day for the time without
service, as well as attorney’s fees. Taking the tenant’s property. [RCW 59.18.310] The
law allows a landlord to take a tenant’s property only
in the case of abandonment. A clause in a rental
agreement which allows the landlord to take a tenant’s
property in other situations is not valid. If the landlord
does take a tenant’s property illegally, the tenant may
want to contact the landlord first. If that is unsuccessful, the police can be

 condemned property. [RCW 59.18.085]

code violations. The landlord can be held liable for
three months rent or treble damages, whichever is
greater, as well
99733 Sanchez Summit Apt. 849

 as costs and attorneys fees for knowingly renting the property. [RCW 59.18.240 -.250] If the tenant exercises rights under the law, such as complaining
to a government authority or deducting for repairs, the
law prohibits the landlord from taking retaliatory action. Examples of retaliatory actions are raising the rent,
reducing services provided to the tenant, or evicting
the tenant. The law initially assumes that these steps
are retaliatory if they occur within 90 days after the tenant’s action, unless the tenant was in some way violating the statute when the change was received. If the
matter is taken to court and the judge finds in favor of
the tenant, the landlord can be ordered to reverse the
retaliatory action, as well as pay for any harm done to
the tenant and pay the tenant’s attorney fees. ENDING THE AGREEMENT
Proper Notice to Leave for Leases. If the tenant
moves out at the expiration of a lease, in most cases it
is not necessary to give the landlord a written notice."|('5768 Alec Station Apt. 950\nLake Kyle, GA 71732', '99733 Sanchez Summit Apt. 849\nWrightside, CT 95409')
"However, the lease should be consulted to be sure a
formal notice is not

 required. If a tenant stays beyond
the expiration of the lease, and the landlord accepts
the next month’s rent, the tenant then is assumed to
be renting under a month-to-month agreement. A tenant who leaves before a lease expires is

A tenant who is the sole occupant of a dwelling unit
can designate a person to act on the tenant’s behalf
upon the death of the tenant independently or at the
request of a landlord. The designation must be in
writing separate from

include the designated person’s name, mailing address, an address used for the receipt of electronic
communications, a telephone number, and a signed

tenant’s death (when the tenant is the sole occupant
of the dwelling unit) to allow the designated person to
access the tenant’s dwelling unit, remove the tenant’s
property, receive refunds of amounts due to the tenant, and to dispose of the tenant’s property consistent
with the tenant’s last will and testament and any applicable intestate succession law, and a conspicuous
statement that the designation remain in effect until it
is revoked in writing by the tenant or replaced with a

Abandonment occurs when a tenant has both fallen

property is being stored and when it will be sold. If
the landlord does not have a new address for the tenant, the notice should be mailed to the rental address,

When a tenant has been served with a writ of restitution in
an eviction action, the tenant will receive written notification of the landlord's responsibilities regarding storing the
tenant's property that is left behind after the premises is
vacant. Tenants will be provided with a form to request
the landlord store the tenant's property. A landlord is required to store the tenant's property if
the tenant makes a written request for storage within
three (3) days of service of the writ of restitution or if
the landlord knows that the tenant is a person with a

"About one in four low-income renters receives housing assistance. [2] Eviction rates are higher in communities with multiple aggravating factors, including high levels of poverty. These include local laws that give advantage to landowners and a lack of available affordable housing that would increase market pressures to keep rents low. [1]

When housing pressures are extreme, even middle-class and working class renters
532 Cameron Views Apt. 343
New Angelamouth, ME 97991
 are evicted by landlords eager to capitalize on the rising market rates, such as in San Francisco during the various tech booms. In such circumstances, landlords may seize upon minor violations that were previously tolerated, such as keeping a small pet or storing a bicycle in the hallway, to evict renters. The situation in California is aggravated by the Ellis Act, which allows landlords to evict tenants and immediately sell the vacant apartments as condominiums. [3]

Evictions disproportionately affect low-income women, in particular women of color. [2] Approximately one in five African-American women renters report being evicted as some point in their life, while the equivalent rate for white women renters is one in 15. [4] Victims of domestic violence and families with children are also at high risk of eviction.

"[4]

Eviction is a cause of poverty, as well as a result of it. The loss of home often results in the loss of community connections, as well as children being forced into a new school. Possessions are routinely lost, as they are placed outside on the sidewalk or placed in storage that can only be accessed by paying a fee. A legal eviction typically goes on the permanent record of the boarder, resulting in automatic rejection by other landlords or housing authorities. [2]

Persons who are evicted lose their jobs at higher rates, either because of the new stress or because the job is no longer easily accessible in a new residence. Mental health often suffers, with one study finding that evicted mothers reported higher rates of depression two years after being expelled. [2]


In both Nassau and Suffolk County, when a landlord goes to court to evict a tenant, the landlord is seeking legal authority to have an enforcement officer physically remove the tenant from the rental premises, restoring possession to the landlord. The landlord is also seeking the authority to attach certain of the tenant’s assets to collect back rent due. This is the foundation of the eviction process in NY. After a landlord wins a landlord tenant eviction proceeding, the judge will issue a judgment of possession (with a money award for any back rent) and a warrant of
171 Tina Spur
Cynthiastad, OK 34599
 eviction."|('171 Tina Spur\nCynthiastad, OK 34599',)
"The judgment of possession is essentially an award by the court to the landlord of possession of the premises. In other words, it confirms the court’s finding that the landlord is entitled to reclaim the premises. The warrant of eviction gives the county sheriff the authority to physically remove the tenant from the premises at the conclusion of the eviction process. Often, landlords do not know what to do with the judgment and warrant of eviction that they receive from the court, as the court is reluctant to provide New York landlord tenant law tips to pro se litigants. This article
4580 Kathleen Groves
Nortonmouth, AL 21369
 will explain the basic steps a landlord can take to enforce both the judgment and warrant of eviction at the conclusion of the court eviction process to have the tenant removed. If the judgment of possession includes a money award for back rent, in order to have it enforced and the warrant executed you must first request that the clerk of the court issue you a transcript of judgment. The fee for this in the District Courts of Nassau and Suffolk County is $6. Once you have your judgment, transcript and warrant in hand, bring the original judgment with transcript and one copy to your county clerk’s office, whose address is listed below:

   Suffolk County Clerk, 310 Center Drive in Riverhead, NY

   Nassau County Clerk, 240 Old Country Road, Mineola, NY

   Request that the clerk stamp your copy as proof of filing and issue you an execution judgment. Upon payment of the requisite $10 fee, the clerk will issue you an execution judgment and will return your copy of the original judgment stamped. Retain the stamped copy for your

West Jeremyshire, RI 32040
 records."|('4580 Kathleen Groves\nNortonmouth, AL 21369', '197 Andrew Island\nWest Jeremyshire, RI 32040')
"Next, bring the execution judgment issued to you by your county clerk and at least eight copies, together with your original warrant of eviction ny and at least six copies thereof, to your county sheriff. If your judgment is for possession only with no money award, you can skip all of the above steps and proceed with your judgment and warrant directly to your local sheriff, whose address is listed below:

   Suffolk County Sheriff, 360 Yaphank Avenue, Suite 1A, Yaphank, New York

   Nassau County Sheriff, 240 Old Country Road, Mineola, New York

    The sheriff’s office may require you to furnish additional copies or information and will provide you with further instructions, including their schedule of fees. They have the authority to enforce your judgment and execute the warrant by physically removing your tenant from the rental property following eviction ny procedures. The sheriff’s office will first serve a 72-hour notice on the tenants, informing them that they have 72-hours to vacate the rental premises, or they will be physically removed. The service of this notice is required by New York landlord tenant law and is made personally by uniformed deputies who come to the house. While they are there, they will note the number of rooms of furniture

 in order to calculate the fee they must charge in the event that they have to return to physically remove the tenants. Most tenants vacate before the 72-hour deadline. For those who do not, the sheriff will return and physically remove the tenants and their property from your rental premises, and you will be able to retake possession at that time. Owners of rental properties at times may know all too well the difficulties that can arise in a tenant/landlord relationship. In some cases, the situation may reach the point where the landlord desires to evict the tenant, whether it be for nonpayment, or some other lease violation."|('6881 Angelica Fields Apt. 803\nNorth Alicia, CA 23127',)
"What is the process that must be followed? There can be a lot of variables in tenant/ landlord cases, so it is important for the landlord to do their research before beginning the process. While the housing court is mostly set up to be navigable without a lawyer, there are some cases in which the consulting of a legal advisor(on the part of either the tenant or the landlord) may be advisable. When a landlord sets out to begin the eviction process, and Notice To Quit will be served to the tenant. The tenant will then have 14 days notice to either pay the amount owed or, if possible, right anything that the landlord is acting on to evict. If the court decides in favor of the landlord, and eviction is going to take place, the eviction can only happen during times when the court is open(landlords cannot force tenants to exit the property over a weekend). Tenants and landlords should contact an experienced Real Estate attorney if any dispute arises which does not have a clear cut definition by the Housing Court, such as whether a tenant can withhold

 rent until certain repairs have been made in the home, or if a landlord is looking to sue a tenant for back rent owed.

 tenant."|('529 Vanessa Square Apt. 519\nMichelletown, MT 63908', 'Unit 5163 Box 9657\nDPO AE 13993')
"On occasion, instead of hiring a landlord tenant lawyer and seeking
3350 Bryan Underpass
Ambermouth, HI 00995
 entitlement to the premises back through the legal system, a landlord tries to instead move all of the unwanted tenant’s belongings out of the rented premises once they cease paying rent. If a wrongful eviction occurs, not only will a wrongfully evicted tenant be allowed back into the premises, but under the Real Property Actions & Proceedings Law, the landlord could face severe financial penalties for their “self help” eviction. In Pernell v 287 Albany Avenue, LLC, a New York Supreme Court Suffolk County action, a tenant sued his former landlord seeking to recover damages for an alleged wrongful eviction. Sometime in 1995, the tenant, Ben Pernell, took occupancy of commercial premises located at 287 Albany Avenue, Amityville, in the Town of Babylon, New York, which consisted of three storefronts in a single building. Mr. Pernell took occupancy of the middle store, opened
369 Robert Views
Lake Jasonmouth, CO 36932
 a delicatessen and convenience store, and made regular monthly rental payments. In 2003, Mr. Pernell informally allowed his cousin Geneva Lee to take over the business, and Ms. Lee began making the monthly rental payments in place of Mr. Pernell. All of the store fixtures and other business equipment were still owned by Mr. Pernell, and remained on the premises. Ms. Lee operated the business until August or September of 2005, and at that time the store closed, and it is assumed that Ms. Lee ceased paying the rent. On December 19, 2005, the property was purchased by new owners, 287 Albany Avenue, LLC, who testified that Mr. Pernell’s store never appeared to be open to them, and that the previous owners, as well as the contract of sale guaranteed delivery of the premises free of tenancies, declaring that the premises were vacant. As such, they claimed, they could not be liable for a wrongful eviction, as no one had informed them that tenants were still in possession of the
21775 Timothy Plains Apt. 035

 premises."|('3350 Bryan Underpass\nAmbermouth, HI 00995', '369 Robert Views\nLake Jasonmouth, CO 36932', '21775 Timothy Plains Apt. 035\nWest William, NH 95338')
"After listening to the facts, the Judge, however, held differently. In December 2005 after the conveyance of the property, Mr. Pernell drove past the premises (which he did on a daily basis), and saw a dumpster in front of his store, the security gates opened, and his padlocks having been forcibly
2694 Valencia Freeway Suite 929
South Kevin, NJ 06554
 removed. Mr. Pernell stopped his vehicle, went inside the store where he spoke with a man there who told him that the building had been sold. He complained to them that he was a tenant who was being wrongfully evicted, but they did nothing. Feeling at a loss, he went to the First Precinct of the Suffolk County Police Department to file a complaint about the wrongful eviction, but he was advised to retain a landlord tenant lawyer, as they could not help him. Mr. Pernell testified that at no time did he receive any notification that the premises had been conveyed, nor had any action been commenced against him by a landlord lawyer to obtain possession of the premises. As such, the entry into the premises and the removal of his belongings constituted a wrongful eviction. The Suffolk County Supreme Court Judge held that even though Mr. Pernell stopped paying rent, he was still a valid tenant, and as such, his tenancy is governed by the terms and conditions set forth in the written lease, and also entitles him to the protection of the Real Property Actions & Proceedings Law, which requires a proper court proceeding to evict a tenant. The entry upon the premises by the new owner without first giving statutory written notice or commencing an eviction proceeding with a landlord lawyer constituted both a wrongful eviction and a trespass, thereby entitling Mr. Pernell to recover damages from the new owner. Ordinarily, the measure of compensatory damages for wrongful eviction would be the value to Plaintiff, above and beyond the rent, of the unexpired term of the leasehold interest plus the actual amount of damages that flow from the wrongful ejectment, North Main Street Bagel Corporation v. Duncan 37 AD3d 785, 831 NYS2d 239 (2nd Dept,

"Since here, Mr. Pernell’s leasehold had no ascertainable value (since he stopped paying rent), his recovery was limited to whatever actual damages he reasonably sustained as a result of the new owner’s actions, which he claimed was $30,000 (the value of the fixtures and equipment on the premises which was wrongfully withheld from him). Mr. Pernell also made a claim for treble damages due to the wrongful eviction. RPAPL § 853 states:

    “If a person is disseized, ejected or put out of real property in a forcible or unlawful manner, or, after he has been put out, is held and kept out by force or by putting him in fear of personal violence or by unlawful means, he is entitled to recover treble damages in an action therefor against the wrong-doer.”

     The wrongful eviction may be either by force or other unlawful means or by the use of force or intimidation after ouster. There need not be any actual violence or intimidation in order to recover treble damages. The Suffolk County

 Supreme Court Judge awarded Mr. Pernell $30,000 for the cost of his fixtures and equipment, together with $90,000 as treble damages for his wrongful eviction, as well as costs and disbursements. Roman mythology is the body of traditional stories pertaining to ancient Rome's legendary origins and religious system, as represented in the literature and visual arts of the Romans. ""Roman mythology"" may also refer to the modern study of these representations, and to the subject matter as represented in the literature and art of other cultures in any period. The Romans usually treated their traditional narratives as historical, even when these have miraculous or supernatural elements. The stories are often concerned with politics and morality, and how an individual's personal integrity relates to his or her responsibility to the community or Roman state. Heroism was an important

 theme."|('681 Erin Run\nEast Robinborough, ND 79476', '571 Johnson Oval\nMichelefort, CA 79142')
"When the stories illuminate Roman religious practices, they
147 Vasquez Ridge
Johnsonborough, KS 40217
 are more concerned with ritual, augury, and institutions than with theology or cosmogony. [1]

The study of Roman religion and myth is complicated by the early influence of Greek religion on the Italian peninsula during Rome's protohistory, and by the later artistic imitation of Greek literary models by Roman authors. In matters of theology, the Romans were curiously eager to identify their own gods with those of the Greeks (interpretatio graeca), and to reinterpret stories about Greek deities under the names of their Roman counterparts. [2] Rome's early myths and legends also have a dynamic relationship with Etruscan religion, less documented than that of the Greeks. While Roman mythology may lack a body of divine narratives as extensive as that found in Greek literature,[3] Romulus and Remus suckling the she-wolf is as famous as any image from Greek mythology except for the Trojan Horse. [4] Because Latin literature was more widely known in Europe throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance, the interpretations of Greek myths by the Romans often had a greater influence on narrative and pictorial representations of ""classical mythology"" than Greek sources. In particular, the versions of Greek myths in Ovid's Metamorphoses, written during the reign of Augustus, came to be regarded as canonical. Narratives of divine activity played a more important role in the system of Greek religious belief than among the Romans, for whom ritual and cult were primary. Although Roman religion did not have a basis in scriptures and exegesis, priestly literature was one of the earliest written forms of Latin prose. [14] The books (libri) and commentaries (commentarii) of the College of Pontiffs and of the augurs contained religious procedures, prayers, and rulings and opinions on points of religious

"[15] Although at least some of this archived material was available for consultation by the Roman senate, it was often occultum genus litterarum,[16] an arcane form of literature
10845 Shepherd Plain Apt. 759
Port Larrybury, VT 75649
 to which by definition only priests had access. [17] Prophecies pertaining to world history and to Rome's destiny turn up fortuitously at critical junctures in history, discovered suddenly in the nebulous Sibylline books, which Tarquin the Proud (according to legend) purchased in the late 6th century BC from the Cumaean Sibyl. Some aspects of archaic Roman religion survived in the lost theological works of the 1st-century BC scholar Varro, known through other classical and Christian authors. The gods represented distinctly the practical needs of daily life, and Ancient Romans scrupulously accorded them the appropriate rites and offerings. Early Roman divinities included a host of ""specialist gods"" whose names were invoked in the carrying out of various specific activities. Fragments of old ritual accompanying such acts as plowing or sowing reveal that at every stage of the operation a separate deity was invoked, the name of each deity being regularly derived from the verb for the operation. Tutelary deities were particularly important in ancient Rome. Thus, Janus and Vesta guarded the door and hearth, the Lares protected the field and house, Pales the pasture, Saturn the sowing, Ceres the growth of the grain, Pomona the fruit, and Consus and Ops the harvest. Even the majestic Jupiter, the ruler of the gods, was honored for the aid his rains might give to the farms and vineyards. In his more encompassing character he was considered, through his weapon of lightning, the director of human

 activity."|('10845 Shepherd Plain Apt. 759\nPort Larrybury, VT 75649', '123 Garcia Bridge Suite 989\nNorth Brenda, KY 54337')
"Due to his widespread domain, the Romans regarded him as their protector in their military activities beyond the borders
87463 Evan Route Suite 365

 of their own community. Prominent in early times were the gods Mars and Quirinus, who were often identified with each other. Mars was a god of war; he was honored in March and October. Modern scholars see Quirinus as the patron of the armed community in time of peace. The 19th-century scholar Georg Wissowa[18] thought that the Romans distinguished two classes of gods, the di indigetes and the di novensides or novensiles: the indigetes were the original gods of the Roman state, their names and nature indicated by the titles of the earliest priests and by the fixed festivals of the calendar, with 30 such gods honored by special festivals; the novensides were later divinities whose cults were introduced

 to the city in the historical period, usually at a known date and in response to a specific crisis or felt need. Arnaldo Momigliano and others, however, have argued that this distinction cannot be maintained. [19] During the war with Hannibal, any distinction between ""indigenous"" and ""immigrant"" gods begins to fade, and the Romans embraced diverse gods from various cultures as a sign of strength and universal divine favor.

Section 1. The executive Power shall be vested in a President
of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during
the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President
chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows:

Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct,
a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives
to which the State may be entitled in the Congress:  but no Senator or
Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under
the United States, shall be appointed an Elector. The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot
for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of
the same State with themselves. And they shall make a List of
all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each;
which List they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to
the Seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the
President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall,
in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives,
open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President,
if such Number be a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed;
and if there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal
Number of votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately
chuse by Ballot one of them for President; and if no Person have
a Majority, then from the five highest on the List the said House
shall in like Manner chuse the President. But in chusing the President,
the Votes shall be taken by States, the Representation from each State
having one Vote; a Quorum for this Purpose shall consist of a Member
or Members from two thirds of the States, and a Majority of all the
States shall be necessary to a Choice. In every Case, after the Choice
of the President, the Person having the greatest Number of Votes of
the Electors shall be the Vice President."|('1258 Brandi Stream\nNew Christine, GA 17366',)
"But if there should remain
two or more who have equal Votes, the Senate shall chuse from them
by Ballot the Vice President. The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors,
and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day
shall be the same throughout the United States. No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States,
at the time of the Adoption of this

 Constitution, shall be eligible to
the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that
Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years,
and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States. In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death,
Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the
said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the
Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation
or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what
Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly,
until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected. The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services,
a Compensation, which shall neither be encreased nor diminished during
the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive
within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them. Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the
following Oath or Affirmation:--""I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that
I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States,
and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the
Constitution of the United States."" The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army
and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States,
when called into the actual Service of the United States;
he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer
in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to
the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power
to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offenses against the United States,
except in Cases of impeachment. He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the
Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators
present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice
and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public
Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other
Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein
otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law:
but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers,
as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law,
or in the Heads of Departments. The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen
during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall
expire at the End of their next session. He shall from time to time give to the Congress
Information of the State of the Union, and recommend to their
Consideration such Measures as he shall judge necessary and expedient;
he may, on extraordinary Occasions, convene both Houses, or either
of them, and in Case of Disagreement between them, with Respect to
the Time of Adjournment, he may adjourn them to such Time as he shall
think proper; he shall receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers;
he shall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed, and shall
Commission all the Officers of the United

We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work. The
time it takes us, a rather conservative estimate, is fifty hours
to get any eBook selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc. Our
projected audience is one hundred million readers. If the value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2
million dollars per hour in 2002 as we release over 100 new text
files per month:  1240 more eBooks in 2001 for a total of 4000+
We are already on our way to trying for 2000 more eBooks in 2002
If they reach just 1-2% of the world's population then the total
will reach over half a trillion eBooks given away by year's end. The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away 1 Trillion eBooks! This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers,
which is only about 4% of the present number of computer users. Here is the briefest record of our progress (* means estimated):

"The Establishment Of The National Judiciary

The monarch of ancient times mingled the functions of priest and judge. It is therefore not altogether surprising that even today a judicial
system should be stamped with a certain resemblance to an ecclesiastical
hierarchy. If the Church of the Middle Ages was ""an army encamped on the
soil of Christendom, with its outposts everywhere, subject to the most
efficient discipline, animated with a common purpose, every soldier
panoplied with inviolability and armed with the tremendous weapons which
slew the soul,"" the same words, slightly varied, may be applied to the
Federal Judiciary created by the American Constitution. The Judiciary of
the United States, though numerically not a large body, reaches through
its process every part of the nation; its ascendancy is primarily a
moral one; it is kept in conformity with final authority by the
machinery of appeal; it is ""animated with a common
7875 Morris Causeway Apt. 092
Burchton, LA 68873
 purpose""; its members
are ""panoplied"" with what is practically a life tenure of their posts;
and it is ""armed with the tremendous weapons"" which slay legislation. And if the voice of the Church was the voice of God, so the voice of the
Court is the voice of the American people as this is recorded in the
Constitution. The Hildebrand of American constitutionalism is John Marshall. The
contest carried on by the greatest of the Chief Justices for the
principles today associated with his name is very like that waged by the
greatest of the Popes for the supremacy of the Papacy. Both fought with
intellectual weapons. Both addressed their appeal to the minds and
hearts of men. Both died before the triumph of their respective causes
and amid circumstances of great discouragement."|('7875 Morris Causeway Apt. 092\nBurchton, LA 68873',)
"Both worked through and
for great institutions which preceded them and which have survived them. And, as the achievements of Hildebrand cannot be justly appreciated
without some knowledge of the ecclesiastical system which he did so much
to develop, neither can the career
0419 Thornton Centers
North Jamesfurt, MD 03633
 of John Marshall be understood
without some knowledge of the organization of the tribunal through which
he wrought and whose power he did so much to exalt. The first chapter in
the history of John Marshall and his influence upon the laws of the land
must therefore inevitably deal with the historical conditions underlying
the judicial system of which it is the capstone. The vital defect of the system of government provided by the soon
obsolete Articles of Confederation lay in the fact that it operated
059 Maldonado Hills
Lake Michelle, AZ 86889
 not
upon the individual citizens of the United States but upon the States in
their corporate capacities. As a consequence the prescribed duties of
any law passed by Congress in pursuance of powers derived from the
Articles of Confederation could not be enforced. Theoretically, perhaps,
Congress had the right to coerce the States to perform their duties; at
any rate, a Congressional Committee headed by Madison so decided at the
very moment (1781) when the Articles were going into effect. But
practically such a course of coercion, requiring in the end the exercise
of military power, was out of the question. Whence were to come the
forces for military operations against recalcitrant States? From sister
States which had themselves neglected their constitutional duties on
various occasions? The history of the German Empire has demonstrated
that the principle of state coercion is entirely feasible when a single
powerful State dominates the rest of the
054 Wagner Vista
Port Kevin, ND 43727
 confederation."|('0419 Thornton Centers\nNorth Jamesfurt, MD 03633', '059 Maldonado Hills\nLake Michelle, AZ 86889', '054 Wagner Vista\nPort Kevin, ND 43727')
"But the
Confederation of 1781 possessed no such giant member; it approximated a
union of equals, and in theory it was entirely such. ¹

¹ By the Articles of Confederation Congress itself was made ""the last
resort of all disputes and differences ... between two or more States
concerning boundary, jurisdiction, or any other cause whatever."" It was
also authorized to appoint ""courts for the trial of piracies and
felonies
3020 Ortiz Land
Cameronmouth, LA 32996
 committed on the high seas"" and ""for receiving and determining
finally appeals in all cases of capture."" But even before the Articles
had gone into operation, Congress had, as early as 1779, established a
tribunal for such appeals, the old Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture. Thus at the very outset, and at a time when the doctrine of state
sovereignty was dominant, the practice of appeals from state courts to a
supreme national tribunal was employed, albeit within a restricted
sphere. Yet it is less easy to admit that the Court of Appeals was, as
has been contended by one distinguished authority, ""not simply the
predecessor but one of the origins of the Supreme Court of the United
States."" The Supreme Court is the creation of the Constitution itself;
it is the final interpreter of the law in every field of national power;
and its decrees are carried into effect by the force and authority of
the Government of which it is one of the three coördinate branches. That
earlier tribunal, the Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture, was, on the
other hand, a purely legislative creation; its jurisdiction was confined
to a single field, and that of importance only in time of war; and the
enforcement of its decisions rested with the state governments. In the Federal Convention of 1787 the idea of state coercion required
little discussion; for the members were soon convinced that it involved
an impracticable, illogical, and unjust principle. The prevailing view
was voiced by Oliver Ellsworth before the Connecticut ratifying
convention: ""We see how necessary for Union is a coercive

A necessary consequence of their principles is a war of the States one

exaggerate the immunity of the States from direct control by the
National Government, for, as James Madison pointed out in the
Federalist, ""in several cases ... they [the States] must be viewed and
proceeded against in their collective capacities."" Yet Ellsworth stated
correctly the controlling principle of the new government: it was to
operate upon individuals through laws interpreted and enforced by its
own courts. A Federal Judiciary was provided for in every plan offered on the floor
of the Federal Convention. There was also a fairly general agreement
among the members on the question of ""judicial

"Indeed,
most of the state constitutions already made the tenure of the principal
judges dependent upon their good behavior, though in some cases judges
were removable, as in England, upon the joint address of the two Houses
of the Legislature. That the Federal judges should be similarly
removable by the President upon the application of the Senate and House
of Representatives was proposed late in the Convention by Dickinson of
Delaware, but the suggestion received the vote of only one State. In the
end it was all but unanimously agreed that the Federal judges should be
removable only upon conviction following impeachment. But, while the Convention was in accord on this
031 Angela Isle
Port Shawnland, MD 87706
 matter, another
question, that of the organization of the new judiciary, evoked the
sharpest disagreement among its members. All believed that there must be
a national Supreme Court to impress upon the national statutes a
construction that should be uniformly binding throughout the country;
but they disagreed upon the question whether there should be inferior
national courts. Rutledge of South Carolina wanted the state courts to
be used as national courts of the first instance and argued that a right
of appeal to the supreme national tribunal would be quite sufficient ""to
secure the national rights and uniformity of judgment."" But Madison
pointed out that such an arrangement would cause appeals to be
multiplied most oppressively and that, furthermore, it would provide no
remedy for improper verdicts resulting from local prejudices. A
compromise was reached by leaving the question to the discretion of
Congress. The champions of local liberties, however, both at
Philadelphia and in the state conventions continued to the end to urge
that Congress should utilize the state courts as national tribunals of
the first instance. The significance of this plea should be emphasized
because the time was to come when the same interest would argue that for
the Supreme Court to take appeals from the state courts on any account
was a humiliation to the latter and an utter disparagement of State
Rights."|('031 Angela Isle\nPort Shawnland, MD 87706',)
"Even more important than the relation of the Supreme Court to the
judicial systems of the States was the question of its relation to the
Constitution as a governing instrument. Though the idea that courts were
entitled to pronounce on the constitutionality of legislative acts had
received countenance in a few dicta in some of the States and perhaps in
one or two decisions, this idea was still at best in 1787 but the germ
of a possible institution. It is not surprising, therefore, that no such
doctrine found place in the resolutions of the Virginia plan which came
before the Convention. By the sixth resolution of this plan the
80891 Patel Extension
Gallowayton, AZ 72752
 national
legislature was to have the power of negativing all state laws which, in
its opinion, contravened ""the Articles of Union, or any treaty
subsisting under the authority of the Union,"" and by the eighth
resolution ""a convenient number of the national judiciary"" were to be
associated with the Executive, ""with authority to examine every act of
the national legislature before it shall operate, and every act of a
particular legislature before a negative thereon shall be final"" and to
impose a qualified veto in either case. But, as discussion in the Convention proceeded, three principles
obtained clearer and clearer recognition, if not from all its members,
certainly from the great majority of them: first, that the Constitution
is law, in the sense of being enforcible by courts; secondly, that
3693 Warren Lane
Thomasborough, CT 99488
 it is
supreme law, with which ordinary legislation must be in harmony to be
valid; and thirdly--a principle deducible from the doctrine of the
separation of powers--that, while the function of making new law belongs
to the legislative branch of the Government, that of expounding the
standing law, of which the Constitution would be part and parcel,
belongs to the Judiciary. The final disposition of the question of
insuring the conformity of ordinary legislation to the Constitution
turned to no small extent on the recognition of these three great
principles. The proposal to endow Congress with the power to negative state
legislation having been rejected by the Convention, Luther Martin of
Maryland moved that ""the legislative acts of the United States made in
virtue and in pursuance of the Articles of Union, and all treaties made
or ratified under the authority of the United States, shall be the
supreme law of the respective States, and the judiciaries of the several
States shall be bound thereby in their decisions, anything in the
respective laws of the individual States to the contrary
notwithstanding."" The motion was agreed to without a dissenting voice
and, with some slight changes, became Article VIII of the report of the
Committee of Detail of the 7th of August, which in turn became ""the
linch-pin of the Constitution."" ¹ Then, on the 27th of August, it was
agreed that ""the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court"" should ""extend to
all cases arising under the laws passed by the Legislature of the United
States,"" whether, that is, such laws should be in pursuance of the
Constitution or not. The foundation was thus laid for the Supreme Court
to claim the right to review any state decision challenging on
constitutional grounds the validity of any act of Congress."|('80891 Patel Extension\nGallowayton, AZ 72752', '3693 Warren Lane\nThomasborough, CT 99488')
"Presently
this foundation was broadened by the substitution of the phrase
""judicial power of the United States"" for the phrase ""jurisdiction of
the Supreme Court,"" and also by the insertion of the words ""this
Constitution"" and ""the"" before the word ""laws"" in what ultimately became
Article III of the Constitution. The implications of the phraseology of
this part of the Constitution are therefore significant:

¹ Article VI, paragraph 2. The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in
one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from
time to time ordain and establish. The judges, both of the Supreme and
inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behavior, and
shall at stated times
38712 David Crescent
Port Williamville, WI 25955
 receive for their services a compensation which
shall not be diminished during their continuance in office. The judicial power shall extend to all cases in law and
equity arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States,
and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority; to all
cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls; to all
cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction; to controversies to which
the United States shall be a party; to controversies between two or more
States, between a State and citizens of another State, between citizens
of different States, between citizens of the same State claiming lands
under grants of different States, and between a State, or the citizens
thereof, and foreign states, citizens, or subjects. Such, then, is the verbal basis of the power of the courts, and
particularly of the Supreme Court,
615 Snyder Streets Apt. 779
South Meganton, OR 43600
 to review the legislation of any
State, with reference to the Constitution, to acts of Congress, or to
treaties of the United States. Nor can there be much doubt that the
members of the Convention were also substantially agreed that the
Supreme Court was endowed with the further right to pass upon the
constitutionality of acts of Congress. The available evidence strictly
contemporaneous with the framing and ratification of the Constitution
shows us seventeen of the fifty-five members of the Convention asserting
the existence of this prerogative in unmistakable terms and only three
using language that can be construed to the contrary. More striking than
that, however, is the fact that these seventeen names include fully
three-fourths of the leaders of the Convention, four of the five members
of the Committee of Detail which drafted the Constitution, and four of
the five members of the Committee of Style which gave the Constitution
its final form. And these were precisely the members who expressed
themselves on all the interesting and vital subjects before the
Convention, because they were its statesmen and articulate

¹ The entries under the names of these members in the Index to Max
Farrand's Records of the Federal Convention occupy fully thirty columns,
as compared with fewer than half as many columns under the names of all
remaining members. No part of the Constitution has realized the hopes of its framers more
brilliantly than has Article III, where the judicial
87966 Vaughn Center Apt. 784
North Jasonshire, NE 56157
 power of the United
States is defined and organized, and no part has shown itself to be more
adaptable to the developing needs of a growing nation. Nor is the reason
obscure: no part came from the hands of the framers in more fragmentary
shape or left more to the discretion of Congress and the Court. Congress is thus placed under constitutional obligation to establish one
Supreme Court, but the size of that Court is for Congress itself to
determine, as well as whether there shall be any inferior Federal Courts
at all. What, it may be asked, is the significance of the word ""shall""
in Section II? Is it merely permissive or is it mandatory? And, in
either event, when does a case arise under the Constitution or the laws
of the United States? Here, too, are questions which are left for
Congress in the first instance and for the Supreme Court in the last. Further, the Supreme Court is given ""original jurisdiction"" in certain
specified cases and ""appellate jurisdiction"" in all others--subject,
however, to ""such exceptions and under such regulations as the Congress
shall make."" Finally, the whole question of the relation of the national
courts to the state judiciaries, though it is elaborately discussed by
Alexander Hamilton in the Federalist, is left by the Constitution itself
to the practically undirected wisdom of Congress, in the exercise of its
power to pass ""all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying

 I, section VIII, 18. Almost the first official act of the Senate of the United States, after
it had perfected its own organization, was the appointment of a
committee ""to bring in a bill for organizing the judiciary of the United
States."" This committee consisted of eight members, five of whom,
including Oliver Ellsworth, its chairman, had been members of the
Federal Convention. To Ellsworth is to be credited largely the
authorship of the great Judiciary Act of September 24, 1789, the
essential features of which still remain after 130 years in full force
and effect. This famous measure created a chief justiceship and five associate
justiceships for the Supreme Court; fifteen District Courts, one for
each State of the Union and for each of the two Territories, Kentucky
and Ohio; and, to stand between these, three Circuit Courts consisting
of two Supreme Court justices and the
10592 Regina Overpass Apt. 178
Ramirezberg, VT 34597
 local district judge. The ""cases""
and ""controversies"" comprehended by the Act fall into three groups:
first, those brought to enforce the national laws and treaties, original
jurisdiction of which was assigned to the District Courts; secondly,
controversies between citizens of different States ¹; lastly, cases
brought originally under a state law and in a State Court but finally
coming to involve some claim of right based on the National
Constitution, laws, or treaties. For these the twenty-fifth section of
the Act provided that, where the decision of the highest State Court
competent under the state law to pass upon the case was adverse to the
claim thus set up, an appeal on the issue should lie to the Supreme
Court. This twenty-fifth section received the hearty approval of the
champions of State Rights, though later on it came to be to them an
object of fiercest resentment. In the Senate, as in the Convention, the
artillery of these gentlemen was trained upon the proposed inferior
Federal Judiciary, which they pictured as a sort of Gargantua ready at
any moment ""to swallow up the state courts."" ¹ Where the national jurisdiction was extended to these in the interest
of providing an impartial tribunal, it was given to the Circuit Courts."|('6678 Jennifer Islands Suite 365\nJennifershire, TN 13765', '10592 Regina Overpass Apt. 178\nRamirezberg, VT 34597')
"The first nominations for the Supreme Court were sent in by Washington
two days after he had signed the Judiciary Act. As finally constituted,
the original bench consisted of John Jay of New York as Chief Justice,
and of John Rutledge of South Carolina, William Cushing of
Massachusetts, John Blair of Virginia, James Wilson of Pennsylvania, and
James Iredell of North Carolina as Associate Justices. All were known to
be champions of the Constitution, three had been members of the Federal
Convention, four had held high judicial offices in their home States,
and all but Jay were on record as advocates of the principle of judicial
review. Jay was one of the authors of the Federalist, had achieved a
great diplomatic reputation in the negotiations of 1782, and possessed
the political backing of the powerful Livingston family of New York. The Judiciary Act provided for two terms of court annually, one
commencing the first Monday of February, and the other on the first
Monday of August. On February 2, 1790, the Court opened its doors for
the first time in an upper room of the Exchange in New York City. Up to
the February term of 1793 it had heard but five cases, and until the
accession of Marshall it had decided but fifty-five. The justices were
largely occupied in what one of them described as their ""post-boy
duties,"" that is, in riding their circuits. At first the justices rode
in pairs and were assigned to particular circuits. As a result of this
practice, the Southern justices were forced each year to make two trips
of nearly two thousand miles each and, in order to hold court for two
weeks, often passed two months on the road."|()
"In 1792, however, Congress
changed the law to permit the different circuits
8295 Timothy Fort
Neilberg, LA 02615
 to be taken in turn and
by single justices, and in the meantime the Court had, in 1791, followed
the rest of the Government to Philadelphia, a rather more central seat. Then, in 1802, the abolition of the August term eased the burdens of the
justices still more. But of course they still had to put up with bad
roads, bad inns, and bad judicial quarters or sometimes none at all. Yet that the life of a Supreme Court justice was not altogether one of
discomfort is shown by the following alluring account of the travels of
Justice Cushing on circuit: ""He traveled over the whole of the Union,
holding courts in Virginia, the Carolinas, and Georgia. His traveling
equipage was a four-wheeled phaeton, drawn by a pair of horses, which he
drove. It was remarkable for its many ingenious arrangements (all of his
contrivance) for carrying books, choice groceries, and other comforts. Mrs. Cushing always accompanied him, and generally read aloud while
riding. His faithful servant Prince, a jet-black negro, whose parents
had been slaves in the family and who loved his master with unbounded
affection, followed."" ¹ Compared with that of a modern judge always
confronted with a docket of eight or nine hundred cases in arrears,
Justice Cushing's lot was perhaps not so unenviable. ¹ Flanders, The Lives and Times of the Chief-Justices of the Supreme

19360 David Wells Apt. 351
Haleyside, NY 14662
 Court in constitutional interpretation
has, for all but special students, fallen into something like obscurity
owing to the luster of Marshall's achievements and to his habit of
deciding cases without much reference to precedent. But these early
labors are by no means insignificant, especially since they pointed the
way to some of Marshall's most striking decisions. In Chisholm vs.
Georgia, ¹ which was decided in 1793, the Court ruled, in the face of an
assurance in the Federalist to the contrary, that an individual might
sue a State; and though this decision was speedily disallowed by
resentful debtor States by the adoption of the Eleventh Amendment, its
underlying premise that, ""as to the purposes of the Union, the States
are not sovereign"" remained untouched; and three years later the Court
affirmed the supremacy of national treaties over conflicting state laws
and so established a precedent which has never been disturbed. ²
Meantime the Supreme Court was advancing, though with notable caution,
toward an assertion of the right to pass upon the constitutionality of
acts of Congress. Thus in 1792, Congress ordered the judges while on
circuit to pass upon pension claims, their determinations to be
reviewable by the Secretary of the Treasury. In protests which they
filed with the President, the judges stated the dilemma which confronted
them: either the new duty was a judicial one or it was not; if the
latter, they could not perform it, at least not in their capacity as
judges; if the former, then their decisions were not properly reviewable
by an executive officer. Washington promptly sent the protests to
Congress, whereupon some extremists raised the cry of impeachment; but
the majority hastened to amend the Act so as to meet the views of the
judges. ³ Four years later, in the Carriage Tax case, 4 the only
question argued before the Court was that of the validity of a
congressional excise. Yet as late as 1800 we find Justice Samuel Chase
of Maryland, who had succeeded Blair in 1795, expressing skepticism as
to the right of the Court to disallow acts of Congress on the ground of
their unconstitutionality, though at the same time admitting that the
prevailing opinion among bench and bar supported the

822 Michelle Branch
Lake Jacob, UT 06336
 lack of the Federal Judiciary during these early years, and it
eventually proved well-nigh fatal, was one of leadership. Jay was a
satisfactory magistrate, but he was not a great force on the Supreme
Bench, partly on account of his peculiarities of temperament and his ill
health, and partly because, even before he resigned in 1795 to run for
Governor in New York, his judicial career had been cut short by an
important diplomatic assignment to England. His successor, Oliver
Ellsworth, also suffered from ill health, and he too was finally
sacrificed on the diplomatic altar by being sent to France in 1799. During the same interval there were also several resignations among the
associate justices. So, what with its shifting personnel, the lack of
business, and the brief semiannual terms, the Court secured only a
feeble hold on the imagination of the country. It may be thought, no
doubt, that judges anxious to steer clear of politics did not require
leadership in the political
7892 Carolyn Ridges

 sense."|('822 Michelle Branch\nLake Jacob, UT 06336', '7892 Carolyn Ridges\nEast Patriciaton, ME 44501')
"But the truth of the matter is that
willy-nilly the Federal Judiciary at this period was bound to enter
politics, and the only question was with what degree of tact and
prudence this should
PSC 9537, Box 5985
APO AE 82047
 be done. It was to be to the glory of Marshall that
he recognized this fact perfectly and with mingled boldness and caution
grasped the leadership which the circumstances demanded. The situation at the beginning was precarious enough. While the
Constitution was yet far from having commended itself to the back
country democracy, that is, to the bulk of the American people, the
normal duties of the lower Federal Courts brought the judges into daily
contact with prevalent prejudices and misconceptions in their most
aggravated forms. Between 1790 and 1800 there were two serious uprisings
against the new Government: the Whisky Rebellion of 1794 and Fries's
Rebellion five years later. During the same period the popular ferment
caused by the French Revolution was at its height. Entrusted with the
execution of the laws, the young Judiciary ""was necessarily thrust
forward to bear the brunt in the first instance of all the opposition
levied against the federal head,"" its revenue measures, its commercial
restrictions, its efforts to enforce neutrality and to quell uprisings. In short, it was the point of attrition between the new system and a
suspicious, excited populace. Then, to make bad matters worse, Congress in 1798 passed the Sedition
Act. Had political discretion instead of party venom governed the
judges, it is not unlikely that they would have seized the opportunity
presented by this measure to declare it void and by doing so would have
made good their censorship of acts of Congress with the approval of even
the Jeffersonian

 opposition."|('PSC 9537, Box 5985\nAPO AE 82047', 'Unit 1911 Box 0577\nDPO AP 77105')
"Instead, they enforced the Sedition Act,
often with gratuitous rigor, while some of them even entertained
prosecutions
575 Mcbride Summit Suite 246
Lake Meganmouth, MD 33629
 under a supposed Common Law of the United States. The
immediate sequel to their action was the claim put forth in the Virginia
and Kentucky Resolutions that the final authority in interpreting the
National Constitution lay with the local legislatures. Before the
principle of judicial review was supported by a single authoritative
decision, it had thus become a partisan issue! ¹

¹ See Herman V. Ames, State Documents on Federal Relations, Nos. A few months later Jefferson was elected President, and the Federalists,
seeing themselves about to lose control of the Executive and Congress,
proceeded to take steps to convert the Judiciary into an avowedly
partisan stronghold. By the Act of February 13, 1801, the number of
associate justiceships was reduced to four, in the hope that the new
Administration might in this way be excluded from the opportunity of
making any appointments to the Supreme Bench, the number of district
judgeships was enlarged by five, and six Circuit Courts were created
which furnished places for sixteen more new judges. When John Adams, the
retiring President, proceeded with the aid of the Federalist majority in
the Senate and of his Secretary of State, John Marshall, to fill up the
new posts with the so-called ""midnight judges,"" ¹ the rage and
consternation of the Republican leaders broke all bounds. The Federal
Judiciary, declared John Randolph, had become ""an hospital of decayed
politicians."" Others pictured the country as reduced, under the weight
of ""supernumerary judges"" and hosts of attendant lawyers, to the
condition of Egypt under the Mamelukes. Jefferson's concern went deeper."|('575 Mcbride Summit Suite 246\nLake Meganmouth, MD 33629',)

Dickinson. ""There the remains of Federalism are to be preserved and fed
from the Treasury, and from that battery all the works of Republicanism
are to be beaten down and destroyed."" The Federal Judiciary, as a
coördinate and independent branch of the Government, was confronted with

 fight for life! ¹ So called because the appointment of some of them was supposed to have
taken place as late as midnight, or later, of March 3-4, 1801. The
supposition, however, was without foundation. Meanwhile, late in November, 1800, Ellsworth had resigned, and Adams had
begun casting about for his successor. First he turned to Jay, who
declined on the ground that the Court, ""under a system so defective,""
would never ""obtain the energy, weight, and dignity which were essential
to its affording due support to the National Government, nor acquire the
public confidence and respect which, as the last resort of the justice
of the nation, it should possess."" Adams now bethought himself of his
Secretary of State and, without previously consulting him, on January
20, 1801, sent his name to the Senate. A week later the Senate ratified
the nomination, and on the 4th of February Marshall accepted the
appointment. The task despaired of by Jay and abandoned by Ellsworth was

"CHAPTER II

Marshall's Early Years

John Marshall was born on September 24, 1755, in Fauquier County,
Virginia. Though like Jefferson he was descended on his mother's side
from
1117 Palmer Shore
Trantown, IL 42345
 the Randolphs of Turkey Island, colonial grandees who were also
progenitors of John Randolph, Edmund Randolph, and Robert E. Lee, his
father, Thomas Marshall, was ""a planter of narrow fortune"" and modest
lineage and a pioneer. Fauquier was then on the frontier, and a few
years after John was born the family moved still farther westward to a
place called ""The Hollow,"" a small depression on the eastern slope of
the Blue Ridge. The external furnishings of the boy's life were
extremely primitive, a fact which Marshall used later to recall by
relating that his mother and sisters used thorns for buttons and
916 Brown Mills
Shirleymouth, SC 42862
 that
hot mush flavored with balm leaf was regarded as a very special dish. Neighbors of course, were few and far between, but society was not
lacking for all that. As the first of fifteen children, all of whom
reached maturity, John found ample opportunity to cultivate that
affectionate helpfulness and gayety of spirit which in after years even
enemies accounted one of his most notable traits. Among the various influences which, during the plastic years of boyhood
and youth, went to shape the outlook of the future Chief Justice high
rank must be accorded his pioneer life. It is not merely that the spirit
of the frontier, with its independence of precedent and its audacity of
initiative, breathes through his great constitutional decisions, but
also that in being of the frontier Marshall escaped being something
else. Had he been born in lowland Virginia, he would have imbibed the
intense localism and individualism of the great plantation, and with his
turn of mind might well have filled the rôle of Calhoun instead of that
very different rôle he actually did fill. There was, indeed, one great
planter with whom young Marshall was thrown into occasional contact, and
that was his father's patron and patron saint,

"The appeal
made to the lad's imagination by the great Virginian was deep and
abiding. And it goes without saying that the horizons suggested by the
fame of Fort Venango and Fort Duquesne were not those of seaboard
Virginia but of America. Many are the great men who
958 Anderson Stream Apt. 950
West Cynthia, CA 31797
 have owed their debt to a mother's loving
helpfulness and alert understanding. Marshall, on the other hand, was
his father's child. ""My father,"" he was wont to declare in after years,
""was a far abler man than any of his sons. To him I owe the solid
foundations of all my success in life."" What were these solid
foundations? One was a superb physical constitution; another was a taste
for intellectual delights; and to the upbuilding of both these in his
son, Thomas Marshall devoted himself with enthusiasm and masculine good
sense, aided on the one hand by a very select library consisting of
Shakespeare, Milton, Dryden, and Pope, and on the other by the ever
fresh invitation of the mountainside to health-giving sports. Pope was the lad's especial textbook, and we are told that he had
transcribed the whole of the Essay on Man by the time he was twelve and
some of the Moral Essays as well, besides having ""committed to memory
many of the most interesting passages of that distinguished poet."" The
result is to be partially discerned many years later in certain tricks
of Marshall's style; but indeed the influence of the great moralist must

"The Essay on Man filled, we may surmise,
much the same place in the education of the first generation of American
judges that Herbert Spencer's Social Statics filled in that of the
judges of a later day. The Essay on Man pictures the universe as a
species of constitutional monarchy governed ""not by partial but by
general laws""; in ""man's imperial race"" this beneficent sway expresses
itself in two principles,

 ""self-love to urge, and reason to restrain"";
instructed by reason, self-love lies at the basis of all human
institutions, the state, government, laws, and has ""found the private in
the public good""; so, on the whole, justice is the inevitable law of
life. ""Whatever is, is right."" It is interesting to suppose that while
Marshall was committing to memory the complacent lines of the Essay on
Man, his cousin Jefferson may have been deep in the Essay on the Origin
of Inequality. At the age of fourteen Marshall was placed for a few months under the
tuition of a clergyman named Campbell, who taught him the rudiments of
Latin and introduced him to Livy, Cicero, and Horace. A little later the
great debate over American rights burst forth and became with Marshall,
as with so many promising lads of the time, the decisive factor in
determining his

for instance, with shaping Webster's genius, came too late to influence
him greatly. The part which the War of Independence had in shaping the ideas and the
destiny of John Marshall was most important. As the news of Lexington
and Bunker Hill passed the Potomac, he was among the first to spring to
arms. His services at the siege of Norfolk, the battles of Brandywine,
Germantown, and Monmouth, and his share in the rigors of Valley Forge
and in the capture of Stony Point, made him an American before he had

"As he himself wrote long
afterwards: ""I had grown up at a time when the love of the Union and the
resistance to Great Britain were the inseparable inmates of the same
bosom; ... when the maxim 'United we stand, divided we fall' was the
maxim of every orthodox American. And I had imbibed these sentiments so
thoroughly that they constituted a part of my being. I carried them with
me into the army, where I found myself associated with brave

 men from
different States, who were risking life and everything valuable in a
common cause believed by all to be most precious, and where I was
confirmed in the habit of considering America as my country and Congress
as my government."" Love of country, however, was not the only quality which soldiering
developed in Marshall. The cheerfulness and courage which illuminated
his patriotism brought him popularity among men. Though but a
lieutenant, he was presently made a deputy judge advocate. In this
position he displayed notable talent in adjusting differences between
officers and men and also became acquainted with Washington's brilliant
young secretary, Alexander Hamilton. While still in active service in 1780, Marshall attended a course of law
lectures given by George Wythe at William and Mary College. He owed this
opportunity to Jefferson, who was then Governor of the State and who had
obtained the abolition of the chair of divinity at the college and the
introduction of a course in law and another in medicine. Whether the
future Chief Justice was prepared to take full advantage of the
opportunity thus offered is, however, a

as much upon

capitulation of Cornwallis, Marshall hung out his shingle at Richmond
and began the practice of his profession. The new capital was still
hardly more than an outpost on the frontier, and conditions of living
were rude in the extreme. ""The Capitol itself,"" we are told, ""was an
ugly structure--'a mere wooden barn'--on an unlovely site at the foot of
a hill. The private dwellings scattered about were poor, mean, little
wooden houses."" ""Main Street was still unpaved, deep with dust when dry

ended in gullies and swamps. Trade, which was still in the hands of the
British merchants, involved for the most part transactions in skins,

¹ Beveridge, vol. But there was one institution of which Richmond could boast, even in
comparison with New York, Boston, or Philadelphia, and that was its Bar. Randolph, Wickham, Campbell, Call, Pendleton, Wythe--these are names
whose fame still survives wherever the history of the American Bar is
cherished; and it was with their living bearers that young Marshall now
entered into competition. The result is somewhat astonishing at first
consideration, for even by the standards of his own day, when digests,
indices, and the other numerous aids which now ease the path of the
young attorney were generally lacking, his preparation had been slight. Several circumstances, however, came to his rescue. So soon after the
Revolution British precedents were naturally rather out of favor, while
on the other hand many of the questions which found their way into the
courts were those peculiar to a new country and so were without
applicable precedents for their solution. What was chiefly demanded of
an attorney in this situation was a capacity for attention, the ability
to analyze an opponent's argument, and a discerning eye for fundamental
issues. Competent observers soon made the discovery that young Marshall
possessed all these faculties to a marked degree and, what was just as
important, his modesty made recognition by his elders easy and gracious. From 1782 until the adoption of the Constitution, Marshall was almost
continuously a member of the Virginia Legislature. He thus became a
witness of that course of policy which throughout this period daily
rendered the state governments more and more ""the hope of their enemies,
the despair of their friends."""|()
"The termination of hostilities against
England had relaxed the already feeble bonds connecting the States. Congress had powers which were only recommendatory, and its
recommendations were ignored by the local legislatures. The army, unpaid
and frequently in actual distress, was so rapidly losing its morale that
it might easily become a prey to demagogues. The treaties of the new
nation were flouted by every State in the Union. Tariff wars and
conflicting land grants embittered the relations of sister States. The
foreign trade of the country, it was asserted, ""was regulated, taxed,
monopolized, and crippled
USCGC Mays
FPO AP 67142
 at the pleasure of the maritime powers of
Europe."" Burdened with debts which were the legacy of an era of
speculation, a considerable part of the population, especially of the
farmer class, was demanding measures of relief which threatened the
security of contracts. ""Laws suspending the collection of debts,
insolvent laws, instalment laws, tender laws, and other expedients of a
like nature, were familiarly adopted or openly and boldly vindicated."" ¹

¹ This review of conditions under the later Confederation is taken from
Story's Discourse, which is in turn based, at this point, on Marshall's
Life of Washington and certain letters of his to Story. From the outset Marshall ranged himself on the side of that party in the
Virginia Legislature which, under the leadership of Madison, demanded
with growing insistence a general and radical constitutional reform
designed at once to strengthen the national power and to curtail state
legislative power."|('USCGC Mays\nFPO AP 67142',)
"His attitude was determined not only by his sympathy
for the sufferings of his former comrades in arms and by his veneration
for his father and for Washington, who were of the same party, but also
by his military experience, which had rendered the pretensions of state
sovereignty ridiculous in his eyes. Local discontent came to a head in
the autumn of 1786 with the outbreak of Shays's Rebellion in western
Massachusetts. Marshall, along with the great body of public men of the
day, conceived for the movement the gravest alarm, and the more so since
he considered it as the natural
USS Rodriguez
FPO AE 79158
 culmination of prevailing tendencies. In
a letter to James Wilkinson early in 1787, he wrote: ""These violent ...
dissensions in a State I had thought inferior in wisdom and virtue to no
one in our Union, added to the strong tendency which the politics of
many eminent characters among ourselves have to promote private and
public dishonesty, cast a deep shade over that bright prospect which the
Revolution in America and the establishment of our free governments had
opened to the votaries of liberty throughout the globe. I fear, and
there is no opinion more degrading to the dignity of man, that those
have truth on their side who say that man is incapable of governing
himself."" Marshall accordingly championed the adoption of the Constitution of 1787
quite as much because of its provisions for diminishing the legislative
powers of the States in the interest of private rights as because of its
provisions for augmenting
263 Jonathan Fork Suite 769
New Brian, NY 22941
 the powers of the General Government. His
attitude is revealed, for instance, in the opening words of his first
speech on the floor of the Virginia Convention, to which he had been
chosen a member from Richmond: ""Mr. Chairman, I conceive that the object
of the discussion now before us is whether democracy or despotism be
most eligible.... The supporters of the Constitution claim the title of
being firm friends of liberty and the rights of man.... We prefer this
system because we think it a well-regulated democracy.... What are the
favorite maxims of democracy? A strict observance of justice and public
faith.... Would to Heaven that these principles had been observed under
the present government. Had this been the case the friends of liberty
would not be willing now to part with

"The point of view which
Marshall here assumed was obviously the same as that from which Madison,
Hamilton, Wilson, and others on the floor of the Federal Convention had
freely predicted that republican liberty must disappear from the earth
unless the abuses of it practiced in many of the States could be
eliminated.

 Marshall's services in behalf of the Constitution in the closely fought
battle for ratification which took place in the Virginia Convention are
only partially disclosed in the pages of Elliot's Debates. He was
already coming to be regarded as one excellent in council as well as in
formal discussion, and his democratic manners and personal popularity
with all classes were a pronounced asset for any cause he chose to
espouse. Marshall's part on the floor of the Convention was, of course,
much less conspicuous than that of either Madison or Randolph, but in
the second rank of the Constitution's
68562 Ann Hollow Apt. 217
Fisherbury, FL 81912
 defenders, including men like
Corbin, Nicholas, and Pendleton, he stood foremost. His remarks were
naturally shaped first of all to meet the immediate necessities of the
occasion, but now and then they foreshadow views of a more enduring
value. For example, he met a favorite contention of the opposition by
saying that arguments based on the assumption that necessary powers
would be abused were arguments against government in general and ""a
recommendation of anarchy."" To Henry's despairing cry that the proposed
system lacked checks, he replied: ""What has become of his enthusiastic
eulogium of the American spirit? We should find a check and control,
when oppressed, from that source. In this country there is no exclusive
personal stock of interest. The interest of the community is blended and
inseparably connected with that of the individual...."|('USNV Nguyen\nFPO AA 22988', '68562 Ann Hollow Apt. 217\nFisherbury, FL 81912')
"When we consult
the common good, we consult our own."" And when Henry argued that a
vigorous union was unnecessary because ""we are separated by the sea from
the powers of Europe,"" Marshall replied: ""Sir, the sea makes them
neighbors of us."" It is worthy
34644 Sarah Mountain Suite 790
Mcdonaldtown, MA 82325
 of note that Marshall gave his greatest attention to the
judiciary article as it appeared in the proposed Constitution. He
pointed out that the principle of judicial independence was here better
safeguarded than in the Constitution of Virginia. He stated in one
breath the principle of judicial review and the doctrine of enumerated
powers. If, said he, Congress ""make a law not warranted by any of the
powers enumerated, it would be considered by the judges as an
infringement of the Constitution which they are to guard; they would not
consider such a law as coming within their jurisdiction. They would
declare it void."" ¹ On the other hand, Marshall scoffed at the idea that
the citizen of a State might bring an original action against another
State in the Supreme Court. His dissections of Mason's and Henry's
arguments frequently exhibit controversial skill of a high order. From
Henry, indeed, Marshall drew a notable tribute to his talent, which was
at the same time proof of his ability to keep friends with his

"It appears in
William Wirt's celebrated Letters of the British Spy:

The [Chief Justice] of the United States is, in his person, tall,
meager, emaciated; his muscles relaxed, and his joints so loosely
connected, as not only to disqualify him, apparently for any vigorous
exertion of body, but to destroy everything like elegance and harmony in
his air and movements. Indeed, in his whole appearance, and demeanour;
dress, attitudes, gesture; sitting, standing or walking; he is as far
removed from the idolized graces of Lord Chesterfield, as any other
gentleman
04768 Bradley Hill
Brennanfort, MI 68468
 on earth. To continue the portrait: his head and face are
small in proportion to his height; his complexion swarthy; the muscles
of his face, being relaxed, give him the appearance of a man of fifty
years of age, nor can he be much younger; his countenance has a faithful
expression of great good humour and hilarity; while his black eyes--that
unerring index--possess an irradiating spirit, which proclaims the
imperial powers of the mind that sits enthroned within. The ""British Spy"" then describes Marshall's personality as an orator at
the time when he was still practicing at the Virginia bar:

His voice [the description continues] is dry and hard; his attitude, in
his most effective orations, was often extremely awkward, as it was not
unusual for him to stand with his left foot in advance, while all his
gestures proceeded from his right arm, and consisted merely in a
vehement, perpendicular swing of it from about the elevation of his head
to the bar, behind which he was accustomed to stand.... [Nevertheless]
if eloquence may be said to consist in the power of seizing the
attention with irresistible force, and never permitting it to elude the
grasp until the hearer has received the conviction which the speaker
intends, [then] this extraordinary man, without the aid of fancy,
without the advantages of person, voice, attitude, gesture, or any of
the ornaments of an orator, deserves to be considered as one of the most
eloquent men in the world.... He possesses one original, and, almost,
supernatural faculty; the faculty of developing a subject by a single
glance of his mind, and detecting at once, the very point on which every
controversy depends. No matter what the question; though ten times more
knotty than the gnarled oak, the lightning of heaven is not more rapid
nor more resistless, than his astonishing penetration. Nor does the
exercise of it seem to cost him an effort. On the contrary, it is as
easy as vision. I am persuaded that his eyes do not fly over a landscape
and take in its various objects with more promptitude and facility, than
his mind embraces and analyzes the most complex subject. Possessing while at the bar this intellectual elevation, which enables
him to look down and comprehend the whole ground at once, he determined
immediately and without difficulty, on which side the question might be
most advantageously approached and
44623 Lori Camp

 assailed."|('04768 Bradley Hill\nBrennanfort, MI 68468', '44623 Lori Camp\nLake Jadestad, NY 92905')
"In a bad cause his art
consisted in laying his premises so remotely from the point directly in
debate, or else in terms so general and so spacious, that the hearer,
seeing no consequence which could be drawn from them, was just as
willing to admit them as not; but his premises once admitted, the
demonstration, however distant, followed as certainly, as cogently, as
inevitably, as any demonstration in Euclid. All his eloquence consists in the apparently deep self-conviction, and
emphatic earnestness of his manner, the correspondent simplicity
40312 Lucas Camp

 and
energy of his style; the close and logical connexion of his thoughts;
and the easy gradations by which he opens his lights on the attentive
minds of his hearers. The audience are never permitted to pause for a moment. There is no
stopping to weave garlands of flowers, to hang in festoons, around a
favorite argument. On the contrary, every sentence is progressive; every
idea sheds new light on the subject; the listener is kept perpetually in
that sweetly pleasurable vibration, with which the mind of man always
receives new truths; the dawn advances in easy but unremitting pace; the
subject opens gradually on the view; until, rising in high

 relief, in
all its native colors and proportions, the argument is consummated by
the conviction of the delighted hearer. What appeared to Marshall's friends as most likely in his early middle
years to stand in the way of his advancement was his addiction to ease
and to a somewhat excessive conviviality. But it is worth noting that
the charge of conviviality was never repeated after he was appointed
Chief Justice; and as to his unstudious habits, therein perhaps lay one
of the causes contributing to his achievement. Both as attorney and as
judge, he preferred the quest of broad, underlying principles, and, with
plenty of time for recuperation from each exertion, he was able to bring
to each successive task undiminished vitality and unclouded attention. What the author of the Leviathan remarks of himself may well be repeated
of Marshall--that he made more use of his brains than of his bookshelves
and that, if he had read as much as most men, he would have been as
ignorant as they. That Marshall was one of the leading members of his profession in
Virginia, the most recent biographical researches unmistakably

"""From 1790 until his election to Congress nine years later,"" Albert J.

every important cause heard and determined by the supreme tribunal of
the State."" Practically
23955 Andrews Stream

 all this litigation concerned property rights,
and much of it was exceedingly intricate. Marshall's biographer also
points out the interesting fact that ""whenever there was more than one
attorney for the client who retained Marshall, the latter almost
invariably was retained to make the closing argument."" He was thus able
to make good any lack of knowledge of the technical issues involved as
well as to bring his great debating powers to bear with the best
advantage. ¹ The Life of John Marshall, vol. II, p. 177. Meanwhile Marshall was also rising into political prominence. From the
first a supporter of Washington's Administration, he was gradually
thrust into the position of Federalist leader in Virginia. In 1794 he
declined the post of Attorney-General, which Washington had offered

"In the following year he became involved in the acrimonious struggle

before meetings
USS Carson

 of citizens defended the treaty so aggressively that its
opponents were finally forced to abandon their contention that it was
unconstitutional and to content themselves with a simple denial that it
was expedient. Early in 1796 Marshall made his first appearance before
the Supreme Court, in the case of Ware vs. Hylton. The fame of his
defense of ""the British Treaty"" during the previous year had preceded
him, and his reception by the Federalist leaders from New York and New
England was notably cordial. His argument before the Court, too, though
it did not in the end prevail, added
0587 Wilson Drive

 greatly to his reputation. ""His
head,"" said Rufus King, who heard the argument, ""is one of the best
organized of any one that I have known."" Either in 1793 or early in the following year, Marshall participated in
a business transaction which, though it did not impart to his political
and constitutional views their original bent, yet must have operated
more or less to confirm his opinions. A syndicate composed of Marshall,
one of his brothers, and two other gentlemen, purchased from the British
heirs what remained of the great Fairfax estate in the Northern Neck, a
tract ""embracing over 160,000 acres of the best land in Virginia."" By an
Act passed during the Revolution, Virginia had decreed the confiscation
of all lands held by British subjects; and though the State had never
prosecuted the forfeiture of this particular estate, she was always
threatening to do so. Marshall's investment thus came to occupy for many
years a precarious legal footing which, it may be surmised, did not a
little to keep alert his natural sympathy for all victims of legislative
oppression. Moreover the business relation which he formed with Robert
Morris in financing the investment brought him into personal contact for
the first time with the interests behind Hamilton's financial program,
the constitutionality of which he had already defended on the

"It was due also
44248 Julia Mountain

 to this business venture that Marshall was at last
persuaded to break through his rule of declining office and to accept
appointment in 1797, together with Pinckney and Gerry, on the famous
""X.Y.Z."" From this single year's employment he
obtained nearly $20,000, which, says his biographer, ""over and above his
expenses,"" was ""three times his annual earnings at the bar""; and the
money came just in the nick of time to save the Fairfax investment, for
Morris was now bankrupt and in jail. But not less important as a result
of his services was the enhanced reputation which Marshall's
correspondence with Talleyrand brought him. His return to Philadelphia
was a popular triumph, and even Jefferson, temporarily discomfited by
the ""X.Y.Z."" disclosures, found it discreet to go through the form of
paying him court--whereby hangs a tale. Jefferson called at Marshall's
tavern. Jefferson thereupon left a card deploring how
""unlucky"" he had been. Commenting years afterwards upon the occurrence,
Marshall remarked that this was one time at least when Jefferson came
near telling the truth. Through the warm insistence of Washington, Marshall was finally
persuaded in the spring of 1799 to stand as Federalist candidate for
Congress in the Richmond district. The expression of his views at this
time is

"A correspondent of an Alexandria newspaper signing
himself ""Freeholder"" put to him a number of questions intended to call
forth Marshall's opinions on the issues of the day. In answering a query
as to whether he favored an alliance with Great Britain, the candidate
declared that the whole of his ""politics respecting foreign nations""
4624 Danielle Estate Apt. 906
Julieberg, MN 09870
 was
""reducible to this single position.... Commercial intercourse with all,
but political ties with none."" But a more pressing issue on which the
public wished information was that furnished by the Alien and Sedition
laws, which Marshall had originally criticized on grounds both of
expediency and of constitutionality. Now, however, he defended these
measures on constitutional grounds, taking the latitudinarian position
that ""powers necessary for the attainment of all objects which are
general in their nature, which interest all America ... would be
naturally vested in the Government of the whole,"" but he declared
himself strongly opposed to their renewal. At the same time he denounced
the Virginia Resolutions as calculated ""to sap the foundations of our
Union."" The election was held late in April, under conditions which must have
added greatly to popular interest. Following the custom in Virginia, the
voter, instead of casting a ballot, merely declared his preference in
the presence of the candidates, the election officials, and the
assembled multitude. In the intensity of the struggle no voter, halt,
lame, or blind, was overlooked; and a barrel of whisky near at hand lent
further zest to the occasion. Time and again the vote in the district
was a tie, and as a result frequent personal encounters took place
between aroused partisans. Marshall's election by a narrow majority in a
borough which was strongly pro-Jeffersonian was due, indeed, not to his
principles but to his personal popularity and to the support which he
received from Patrick Henry, the former Governor of the

independence of character, moderation of views, and level good sense, of
which his various congressional activities afford abundant evidence. Though he had himself been one of the ""X.Y.Z."" mission, Marshall now
warmly supported Adams's policy of renewing diplomatic relations with
France. He took his political life in his hands to register a vote
against the Sedition Act, a proposal to repeal which was brought before
the House. He foiled a scheme which his party associates had devised, in
view of the approaching presidential election, to transfer to a
congressional committee the final authority in canvassing the electoral

 and Correspondence of

President, at whose most earnest insistence he entered the Cabinet as
Secretary of State, though he had previously declined to become
Secretary of War. The presidential campaign was the engrossing interest
of the year, and as it spread its ""havoc of virulence"" throughout the
country, Federalists of both factions seemed to turn to Marshall in the
hope that, by some miracle of conciliation, he could save the day. The
hope proved groundless, however, and all that was ultimately left the
party which had founded the Government was to choose a President from
the rival leaders of the opposition. Of these Marshall preferred Burr,
because, as he explained, he knew Jefferson's principles better. Besides
having foreign prejudices, Mr. Jefferson, he continued, ""appears to me
to be a man who will embody himself with the House of Representatives,

his party; he already had a national reputation as an interpreter of

 the
Constitution."|('950 Amber Dam\nHansenbury, MD 91859', '180 Ayala Trail Apt. 481\nSouth Erin, OH 74696')
"Yet his appointment as Chief Justice aroused criticism
even among his party friends. Their doubt did not touch his intellectual
attainments, but in their opinion his political moderation, his
essential democracy, his personal amiability, all counted against him. ""He is,"" wrote Sedgwick, ""a man of very affectionate disposition, of
great simplicity of manners, and honest and honorable in all his
conduct. He is attached to pleasures, with convivial habits strongly
fixed. He is indolent therefore. He has a strong attachment to
popularity but is indisposed to sacrifice to it his integrity; hence he
is disposed on all popular subjects to feel the public pulse, and hence
results indecision and an expression of doubt."" It was perhaps fortunate for the Federal Judiciary, of which he was now
to take command, that John Marshall was on occasion ""disposed ... to
feel the public pulse."" A headstrong pilot might speedily have dashed
his craft
1893 Lori Dam

 on the rocks; a timid one would have abandoned his course; but
Marshall did neither. The better answer to Sedgwick's fears was given in
1805 when John Randolph declared that Marshall's ""real worth was never
known until he was appointed Chief Justice."" And Sedgwick is further
confuted by the portraits of the Chief Justice, which, with all their
diversity, are in accord on that stubborn chin, that firm placid mouth,
that steady, benignant gaze, so capable of putting attorneys out of
countenance when they had to face it overlong."|('1893 Lori Dam\nEast Alexanderhaven, CT 88634',)
"Here are the lineaments
of self-confidence unmarred by vanity, of dignity without condescension,
of tenacity untouched by fanaticism, and above all, of an easy
conscience and unruffled serenity. It required the lodestone of a great
and thoroughly congenial responsibility to bring to light Marshall's
real metal. CHAPTER III

Jefferson's War On The Judiciary

By a singular coincidence
438 Elizabeth Cliffs Suite 768
Cynthiafurt, NM 79305
 Marshall took his seat as Chief Justice at the
opening of the first term of Court in Washington, the new capital, on
Wednesday, February 4, 1801. The most beautiful of capital cities was
then little more than a swamp, athwart which ran a streak of mire named
by solemn congressional enactment ""Pennsylvania Avenue."" At one end of
this difficult thoroughfare stood the President's mansion--still in the
hands of the builders but already sagging and leaking through the
shrinkage of the green timber they had used--two or three partially
constructed office-buildings, and a few private edifices and boarding
houses. Marshall never removed his residence to Washington but occupied
chambers in one or other of these buildings, in company with some of the
associate justices. This arrangement was practicable owing to the
brevity of the judicial term, which usually lasted little more
21255 Jarvis Squares
Port Chris, MD 75466
 than six
weeks, and was almost necessitated by the unhealthful climate of the
place. It may be conjectured that the life of John Marshall was
prolonged for some years by the Act of 1802, which abolished the August
term of court, for in the late summer and early autumn the place swarmed
with mosquitoes and reeked with malaria. The Capitol, which stood at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue, was in
1801 even less near completion than the President's house; at this time
the south wing rose scarcely twenty feet above its foundations. In the
north wing, which was nearer completion, in a basement chamber,
approached by a small hall opening on the eastern side of the Capitol
and flanked by pillars carved to represent bundles of cornstalks with
ears half opened at the top, Marshall held court for more than a third
of a century and elaborated his great principles of constitutional
1708 Jessica Landing Apt. 418

 law."|('438 Elizabeth Cliffs Suite 768\nCynthiafurt, NM 79305', '21255 Jarvis Squares\nPort Chris, MD 75466', '1708 Jessica Landing Apt. 418\nPatriciaview, WV 19674')
"This room, untouched by British vandalism in the invasion of 1814, was
christened by the witty malignity

 of John Randolph, ""the cave of
Trophonius."" ¹

¹ It should, however, be noted in the interest of accuracy, that the
Court does not seem to have occupied its basement chamber during the
years 1814 to 1818, while the Capitol was under repair. It was in the Senate Chamber in this same north wing that Marshall
administered the oath of office to Jefferson just one month after he
himself had taken office. There have been in American history few more
dramatic moments, few more significant, than this occasion when these
two men confronted each other. They detested each other with a
detestation rooted in the most essential differences of character and
outlook. As good fortune arranged it, however, each came to occupy
precisely that political
894 Maria Mission
Lake Cheyenneberg, NH 23711
 station in which he could do his best work and
from which he could best correct the bias of the other. Marshall's
nationalism rescued American democracy from the vaguer horizons to which
Jefferson's cosmopolitanism beckoned, and gave to it a secure abode with
plenty of elbow-room. Jefferson's emphasis on the right of the
contemporary majority to shape its own institutions prevented Marshall's
constitutionalism from developing a privileged aristocracy. Marshall was
finely loyal to principles accepted from others; Jefferson was
speculative, experimental; the personalities of these two men did much
to conserve essential values in the American Republic. As Jefferson turned from his oath-taking to deliver his inaugural,
Marshall must have listened with attentive ears for some hint of the
attitude which the new Administration proposed to take with regard to
the Federal Judiciary and especially with regard to the recent act
increasing its numbers; but if so, he got nothing for his
2566 Lauren Brook

 pains."|('50276 Douglas Run\nOsborneshire, MN 38369', '894 Maria Mission\nLake Cheyenneberg, NH 23711', '2566 Lauren Brook\nLake Kevinville, ID 52043')
"The new
President seemed particularly bent upon dispelling any idea that there
was to be a political proscription. Let us, said he, ""unite with one
heart and one mind. Let us restore to social intercourse that harmony
and affection without which liberty
32157 Wilson Manors Apt. 562
Lake Jamesview, VT 29961
 and even life itself are but dreary
things.... Every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. We have called by different names brethren of the same principle. We are
all Republicans, we are all Federalists."" Notwithstanding the reassurance of these words, the atmosphere both of
official Washington and of the country at large was electric with
dangerous currents--dangerous especially to judges--and Jefferson was
far too well known as an adept in the manipulation of political
lightning to admit of much confidence that he would fail to turn these
forces against his enemy when the opportune moment should arrive. The
national courts were regarded with more distrust by the mass of
Republicans than any other part of the hated system created by the once
dominant Federalists. The reasons why this was so have already been
indicated, but the most potent reason in 1801, because it was still
freshest in mind, was the domineering part which the national judges had
played in the enforcement of the Sedition Act. The terms of this
illiberal measure made, and were meant to make, criticism of the party
in power dangerous. The judges--Federalists to a man and bred, moreover,
in a tradition which ill distinguished the office of judge from that of
prosecutor--felt little call to mitigate the lot of those who fell
within the toils of the law under this
97464 Allen Mount

 Act."|('32157 Wilson Manors Apt. 562\nLake Jamesview, VT 29961', '97464 Allen Mount\nNorth Levi, MS 34626')
"A shining mark for the
Republican enemies of the Judiciary was Justice Samuel Chase of the
Supreme Court. It had fallen to Chase's lot to preside successively at
the trial of Thomas Cooper for sedition, at the second trial of John
Fries for treason, and at the trial of James Thompson Callender at
Richmond for sedition. On each of the two latter occasions the
defendant's counsel, charging ""oppressive conduct"" on the part of the
presiding judge, had thrown up their briefs and rushed from the court
room. In 1800 there were few Republicans who did not regard Chase as
""the bloody Jeffreys of America."" Local conditions also frequently accentuated the prevailing prejudice
against the Judiciary. The people of Kentucky, afraid that their badly
tangled land titles were to be passed upon by the new Federal Courts,
were already insisting, when Jefferson took office, that the Act of the
13th of February creating these courts be repealed. In Maryland
extensive and radical alterations of the judicial system of the State
were pending. In Pennsylvania the situation was even more serious, for
though the judges of the higher courts of that commonwealth were usually
men of ability, education, and character, the inferior magistrates were
frequently the very opposite. By the state constitution judges were
removable for serious offenses by impeachment, and for lesser reasons by
the Governor upon the address of two-thirds of both branches of the
Legislature. So long, however, as the Federalists had remained in power
neither remedy had been applied; but in 1799, when the Republicans had
captured both the governorship and the Legislature, a much needed
purgation of the lower courts had forthwith
2044 Andrew Manor Suite 998
New Alejandroburgh, WV 12436
 begun."|('2044 Andrew Manor Suite 998\nNew Alejandroburgh, WV 12436',)
"Unfortunately this is a sort of reform that grows by what it feeds upon. Having got rid of the less fit members of the local judiciary, the
Republican leaders next turned their attention to some of their
aggressive party foes on the Superior Bench. The most offensive of these
was Alexander Addison, president of one of the Courts of Common Pleas
Unit 3619 Box 9140
DPO AP 81959
 of
the State. He had started life as a Presbyterian preacher and had found
it natural to add to his normal judicial duties the business of
inculcating ""sound morals and manners."" ¹ Addison had at once taken the
Alien and Sedition laws under his wing, though their enforcement did not
fall within his jurisdiction, and he found in the progress of the French
Revolution numerous texts for partisan harangues to county juries. For
some reason Addison's enemies decided to resort to impeachment rather
than to removal by address; and, as a result, in January, 1803, the
State Senate found him guilty of ""misdemeanor,"" ordered his removal from
office, and disqualified him for judicial office in Pennsylvania. Not
long afterwards the House of Representatives granted without
02962 Blake Fork Suite 470
Leechester, WY 10694
 inquiry or
discussion a petition to impeach three members of the Supreme Court of
the State for having punished one Thomas Passmore for contempt of court
without a jury trial. ¹ President Dickinson of Pennsylvania wrote the Chief Justice and judges
of the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth, on October 8, 1785, that they
ought not to content themselves merely with enforcing the law, but
should also endeavor to ""inculcate sound morals and manners."" Pennsylvania Archives, vol. Jefferson entered office with his mind made up that the Act of the 13th
of February should be

"¹ He lacked only a theory whereby he
could reconcile this action with the Constitution, and that was soon
forthcoming.
424 Bradley Common Suite 225
Pattersonton, AR 58432
 According to the author of this theory, John Taylor of
Caroline, a budding ""Doctor Irrefragabilis"" of the State Rights school,
the proposed repeal raised two questions: first, whether Congress could
abolish courts created by a previous act of Congress; and second,
whether, with such courts abolished, their judges still retained office. Addressing himself to the first question, Taylor pointed out that the
Act of the 13th of February had itself by instituting a new system
abolished the then existing inferior courts. As to the second point, he
wrote thus: ""The Constitution declares that the judge shall hold his
office during good behavior. Could it mean that he should hold office
after it had been abolished? Could it mean that his tenure should be
limited by behaving well in an office which did not exist?"" A
construction based on such absurdities, said he, ""overturns the benefits
of language and intellect."" ¹ In this connection Mr. Beveridge draws my attention to Jefferson's
letter to A. Stuart of April 5, 1801. See the Complete Works of
Jefferson (Washington, 1857), vol. IV, p. 393."|('424 Bradley Common Suite 225\nPattersonton, AR 58432',)
"In his message of December 8, 1801, Jefferson gave the signal for the
repeal of the obnoxious measure, and a month later Breckinridge of
Kentucky introduced the necessary resolution in the Senate. In the
prolonged debate which followed, the Republicans in both Senate and
House rang the changes on Taylor's argument. The Federalists made a
twofold answer. Some, accepting the Republican premise that the fate of
the judge was necessarily involved with that of the court, denied
174 Allen Row Apt. 990
Caldwellburgh, WY 11473
 in
toto the validity of repeal. Gouverneur Morris, for instance, said: ""You
shall not take the man from the office but you may take the office from
the man; you may not drown him, but you may sink his boat under him....
Is this not absurd?"" Other Federalists, however, were ready to admit
that courts of statutory origin could be abolished by statute but added
that the
89669 Lisa Falls
Richardville, GA 34553
 operation of Congress's power in this connection was limited by
the plain requirement of the Constitution that judges of the United
States should hold office during good behavior. Hence, though a valid
repeal of the Act in question would take from the judges the powers
which they derived from its provisions, the repeal would still leave
them judges of the United States until they died, resigned, or were
legally removed in consequence of impeachment. The Federalist orators in
general contended that the spirit of the Constitution confirmed its
letter, and that its intention was clear that the national judges should
pass finally upon the constitutionality of acts of Congress and should
therefore be as secure as possible from legislative molestation. The repeal of this Act was voted by a strict party majority and was
reënforced by a provision postponing the next session of the Supreme
Court until the following February. The Republican leaders evidently
hoped that by that time all disposition to test the validity of the
Repealing Act in the Court would have

 passed."|('174 Allen Row Apt. 990\nCaldwellburgh, WY 11473', '89669 Lisa Falls\nRichardville, GA 34553', '720 Crystal Lodge Suite 049\nFlowersborough, WV 01832')
"But by this very
precaution they implied a recognition of the doctrine of judicial review
and the whole trend of the debate abundantly confirmed this implication. Breckinridge, Randolph, and Giles, it is true, scouted the claim made
for the courts as ""unheard-of doctrine,"" and as ""mockery of the high
powers of legislation""; but the rank and file of their followers,
8875 Cook Shoal
Laurenside, AK 38495
 with
the excesses of the French Revolution a recent memory and a
""consolidated government"" a recent fear, were not to be seduced from
what they clearly regarded as established doctrine. Moreover, when it
came to legislation concerning the Supreme Court, the majority of the
Republicans again displayed genuine moderation, for, thrusting aside an
obvious temptation to swamp that tribunal with additional judges of
their own creed, they merely restored it to its original size under the
Act of 1789. Nevertheless the most significant aspect in the repeal of the Act of the
13th of February was the fact itself. The Republicans had not shown a
more flagrant partisanism in effecting this repeal than had the
Federalists in originally enacting the measure which was now
PSC 2065, Box 0362
APO AP 74282
 at an end. Though the Federalists had sinned first, the fact nevertheless remained
that in realizing their purpose the Republican majority had established
a precedent which threatened to make of the lower Federal Judiciary the
merest cat's-paw of party convenience. The attitude of the Republican
leaders was even more menacing, for it touched the security of the
Supreme Court itself in the enjoyment of its highest prerogative and so
imperiled the unity of the nation. Beyond any doubt the moment was now
at hand when the Court must prove to its supporters that it was still
worth defending and to all that the Constitution had an authorized final
interpreter. Marshall's first constitutional case was that of Marbury vs. Madison. ¹
The facts of this famous litigation are simple."|('8875 Cook Shoal\nLaurenside, AK 38495', 'PSC 2065, Box 0362\nAPO AP 74282')
"On March 2, 1801,
William Marbury had been nominated by President Adams to the office of
Justice of the Peace in the District of Columbia for five years; his
nomination had been ratified by the Senate; his commission had been
signed and sealed; but it had not yet been delivered when Jefferson took
office. The new President ordered Madison, his Secretary of State, not
to deliver the commission. Marbury then applied to the Supreme Court for
a writ of mandamus to the Secretary of State under the supposed
authorization of the
3978 Gonzalez Drives
West Curtis, SC 20653
 thirteenth section of the Act of 1789, which
empowered the Court to issue the writ ""in cases warranted by the
principles and usages of law to ... persons holding office under the
authority of the United States."" The Court at first took jurisdiction of
the case and issued a rule to the Secretary of State ordering him to
show cause, but it ultimately dismissed the suit for want of
jurisdiction on the ground that the thirteenth section was
unconstitutional. ¹ 1 Cranch, 137. The following account of the case is drawn largely upon
my Doctrine of Judicial Review (Princeton, 1914). Such are the lawyer's facts of the case; it is the historian's facts
about it which are today the interesting and instructive ones. Marshall,
reversing the usual order of procedure, left the question of
jurisdiction till the very last, and so created for himself an
opportunity to lecture the President on his duty to obey the law and to
deliver the commission. Marshall based his homily on the questionable
assumption that the President had not the power to remove Marbury from
office, for if he had this power the nondelivery of the document was of
course immaterial. Marshall's position was equally questionable when he
contended that the thirteenth section violated that clause of Article
III of the Constitution which gives the Supreme Court original
jurisdiction ""in all cases affecting ambassadors, other public
ministers, and consuls, and those in which a State shall be party."""|('3978 Gonzalez Drives\nWest Curtis, SC 20653',)
"These words, urged the Chief Justice, must be given an exclusive sense
""or they have no operation at all."" This position is quite untenable,
for even when given only their affirmative value these words still place
the cases enumerated beyond the reach of Congress, and this may have
been their only purpose. However, granting the Chief Justice his view of
Article III, still we are not forced to challenge the validity of what
Congress had done. For the view taken a little later by the Court was
that it was not the intention of Congress by this language to confer any
jurisdiction at all, but only to give the right to issue the
572 Cindy Walk Apt. 842
Samanthabury, MS 83086
 writ where
the jurisdiction already existed. What the Court should have done,
allowing its view of Article III to have been correct,
81015 Hanson Ridges
Lake Aaron, NJ 14849
 was to dismiss
the case as not falling within the contemplation of section thirteen,
and not on the ground of the unconstitutionality of that section. Marshall's opinion in Marbury vs. Madison was a political coup of the
first magnitude, and by it he achieved half a dozen objects, some of the
greatest importance. In the first place, while avoiding a direct
collision with the executive power, he stigmatized his enemy Jefferson
as a violator of the laws which as President he was sworn to support. Again, he evaded the perilous responsibility of passing upon the
validity of the recent Repeal Act in quo warranto proceedings, such as
were then being broached. ¹ For if the Supreme Court could not issue the
writ of mandamus in suits begun in it by individuals, neither could it
issue the writ of quo warranto in such suits. Yet again Marshall scored
in exhibiting the Court in the edifying and reassuring light of
declining, even from the hands of Congress, jurisdiction to which it was
not entitled by the Constitution, an attitude of self-restraint which
emphasized tremendously the Court's claim to the function of judicial
review, now first definitely registered in deliberate judicial
822 Christopher Inlet Suite 927

 decision."|('572 Cindy Walk Apt. 842\nSamanthabury, MS 83086', '81015 Hanson Ridges\nLake Aaron, NJ 14849', '822 Christopher Inlet Suite 927\nKellymouth, NH 02950')
"¹ See Benton's Abridgment of the Debates of Congress, vol. Marshall expressed the opinion in private that the repealing act
was ""operative in depriving the
906 Evans Overpass Apt. 599
Haleyland, NV 58122
 judges of all power derived from the act
repealed"" but not their office, ""which is a mere capacity, without new
appointment, to receive and exercise any new judicial power which the
legislature may confer."" Quoted by W. S. Carpenter in American Political
Science Review, vol. IX, p. 528. At this point in Marshall's handling of the case the consummate debater
came to the assistance of the political strategist. Every one of his
arguments in this opinion in support of judicial review will be found
anticipated in the debate on the Repeal Act. What Marshall did was to
gather these arguments together, winnow them of their trivialities,
inconsistencies, and irrelevancies,
30483 Adam Passage
Anthonyberg, MS 02579
 and compress the residuum into a
compact presentation of the case which marches to its conclusion with
all the precision of a demonstration from Euclid. The salient passages of this part of his opinion are the following:

[In the United States] the powers of the legislature are defined and
limited; and that those limits may not be mistaken, or forgotten, the
Constitution is written. To what purpose are powers limited, and to what
purpose is that limitation committed in writing if these limits may, at
any time, be passed by those intended to be restrained? The distinction
between a government with limited and unlimited powers is abolished, if
those limits do not confine the persons on which they are imposed, and
if acts prohibited and acts allowed are of equal
553 Carrie Forest
Gonzalesside, MD 57231
 obligation."|('906 Evans Overpass Apt. 599\nHaleyland, NV 58122', '30483 Adam Passage\nAnthonyberg, MS 02579', '553 Carrie Forest\nGonzalesside, MD 57231')
"It is a
proposition too plain to be contested: that the Constitution controls
any legislative act repugnant to it; or, that the legislature may alter
the Constitution by an ordinary act. [If, then,] an act of the legislature, repugnant to the Constitution, is
void, does it, notwithstanding its invalidity, bind the courts, and
oblige them to give it effect? Or, in other words, though it be not law,
does it constitute a rule as operative as if it was a law? This would be
to overthrow in fact what was established in theory; and would seem, at
first view, an absurdity too gross to be insisted on. It shall, however,
receive a more attentive consideration. It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to
say what the law is. Those who apply the rule
53589 Brandon Ways Apt. 008
Garrettborough, LA 76159
 to particular cases, must
of necessity expound and interpret that rule. If two laws conflict with
each other, the courts must decide on the operation of each. So if a law
be in opposition to the Constitution; if both the law and the
Constitution apply to a particular case, so that the court must either
decide that case conformably to the law, disregarding the Constitution,
or conformably to the Constitution, disregarding the law, the court must
determine which of these conflicting rules governs the case. This is of
the very essence of judicial
326 Frazier Shoal
Meganmouth, NV 95841
 duty."|('53589 Brandon Ways Apt. 008\nGarrettborough, LA 76159', '326 Frazier Shoal\nMeganmouth, NV 95841')
"[However, there are those who maintain] that courts must close their
eyes on the Constitution, and see only the law.... This doctrine would
subvert the very foundation of all written constitutions. It would
declare that an act which, according to the principles and theory of our
government, is entirely void, is yet, in practice, completely
obligatory. It would declare that if the legislature shall do what is
expressly forbidden, such act, notwithstanding the express prohibition,
is in reality effectual. [Moreover,] the peculiar expressions of the Constitution of the United
States furnish additional arguments in favor of its rejection. The
judicial power of the United States is extended to all cases arising
under the Constitution. Could it be the intention of those who gave this
power, to say that in using it the Constitution should not be looked
into? That a case arising under the Constitution should be decided
without examining the instrument under which it arises? This is too
extravagant to be maintained. In some cases, then, the Constitution must be looked into by the judges."|()
"And if they can
3953 Phillips View
Port Dillon, OK 53094
 open it at all, what part of it are they forbidden to
read or to obey? There are many other parts of the Constitution which
serve to illustrate this subject.... ""No person,"" says the Constitution,
""shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses
to the same overt act, or on confession in open court."" Here the
language of the Constitution is addressed especially to the courts. It
prescribes, directly for them, a rule of evidence not to be departed
from. If the legislature should change that rule, and declare one
witness, or a confession out of court, sufficient for conviction, must
the constitutional principle yield to the legislative act? It is also not entirely unworthy of observation, that in declaring what
shall be the supreme law of the land, the Constitution itself is first
mentioned; and not the laws of the United States generally, but those
only which shall be made in pursuance of the Constitution, have that
rank. Thus, the particular phraseology of the Constitution of the United
States confirms and strengthens the principle, supposed to be essential
to all written constitutions, that a law repugnant to the Constitution
is void; and that courts, as well as other departments are bound by that
instrument. There is not a false step in Marshall's argument. It is, for instance,
not contended that the language of the Constitution establishes judicial
review but only that it ""confirms and strengthens the principle."" Granting the finality of judicial decisions and that they may not be
validly disturbed by legislative enactment, the argument is logically
conclusive, whatever practical difficulties it may
489 Deborah Curve

 ignore."|('3953 Phillips View\nPort Dillon, OK 53094', '489 Deborah Curve\nSilvaville, ID 41041')
"Turning back to the case itself, we ought finally to note how Marshall
utilized this opportunity to make manifest the newly found
Unit 2422 Box 9479
DPO AP 18867
 solidarity of
the Court. For the first time in its history the Court was one voice,
speaking through its Chief Justice the ineluctable decrees of the law. Ordinarily even Marshall would not have found this achievement an easy
task, for there were difficult personalities among his associates. He
had in Adams's Cabinet demonstrated his faculty ""of putting his ideas
into the minds of others, unconsciously to them,"" and of this power he
now made use, as well as of the advantage to be obtained from the
impending common danger. The case of Marbury vs. Madison was decided on February 24, 1803, and
therefore fell between two other events which were immediately of almost
as great importance in the struggle now waxing over the judiciary. The
first of these was the impeachment of Judge Pickering of the New
Hampshire District Court, which was suggested by the President on the 3d
of February and voted by the House on the 18th of February; the other
was an address which Justice Chase delivered on the 2d of May to a
Baltimore grand jury, assailing the repeal of the Judiciary Act and
universal
1210 Deleon Shoal
Brownburgh, AZ 85051
 suffrage and predicting the deterioration of ""our republican
Constitution ... into a mobocracy, the worst of all possible
governments."" ¹ Considering the fact that the President was still
smarting from the Chief Justice's lash and also that Chase himself was
more heartily detested by the Republicans than any other member of the
Supreme Bench, nothing could have been more untimely than this fresh
judicial excursion into the field of ""manners and morals,"" and partisan
malice was naturally alert to interpret it as something even more
offensive. The report soon came from Baltimore that Chase had
deliberately assailed the Administration as ""weak, pusillanimous,
relaxed,"" and governed by the sole desire of continuing ""in unfairly
acquired power."" But even before this intelligence arrived, Jefferson
had decided that the opportunity afforded by Chase's outburst was too
good a one to be neglected. Writing on the 13th of May to Nicholson of
Maryland, who already had Pickering's impeachment in charge, the
President inquired: ""Ought this seditious and official attack on the
principles of our Constitution and the proceedings of a State go
unpunished?"""|('Unit 2422 Box 9479\nDPO AP 18867', '1210 Deleon Shoal\nBrownburgh, AZ 85051')
"But he straightway added: ""The question is for your
consideration; for myself it is better
794 Rivera Terrace
Patrickland, SD 11967
 I should not interfere."" ¹ The account here given of Chase's trial is based on Charles Evans's
shorthand Report (Baltimore, 1805), supplemented by J. Q. Adams's
Memoirs. Pickering's trial began on March 2, 1804, and had a bearing on Chase's
fate which at once became clear. The evidence against the New Hampshire
judge showed intoxication and profanity on the bench and entire
unfitness for office, but further evidence introduced in his behalf
proved the defendant's insanity; and so the question at once arose
whether an insane man can be guilty of ""high crimes and misdemeanors?"" Greatly troubled by this new aspect of the case, the Senate none the
less voted Pickering guilty ""as charged,"" by the required two-thirds
majority, though eight members refused to vote at all. But the exponents
of ""judge-breaking"" saw only the action of the Senate and were blind to
its hesitation. On the same day on which the Senate gave its verdict on
Pickering, the House by a strictly partisan vote decreed Chase's
impeachment. The charges against Chase were finally elaborated in eight articles. The
substance of the first six was that he had been guilty of ""oppressive
conduct"" at the trials of John Fries and James Thompson Callender. The
seventh charged him with having attempted at some time in 1800 to
dragoon a grand jury at Newcastle, Delaware, into bringing forward an
accusation of sedition against a local

 paper."|('794 Rivera Terrace\nPatrickland, SD 11967', '46693 Zamora Pine Suite 216\nKempchester, OR 14138')
"These seven articles
related therefore to transactions already four or five years old. The
eighth article alone was based on the address at Baltimore, which it
characterized as ""an intemperate and inflammatory political harangue,""
delivered ""with intent to excite the fears and resentment ... of the
good
PSC 6584, Box 4854
APO AP 10092
 people of Maryland against their State Government and Constitution,
... and against the Government of the United States."" But the charges framed against Chase revealed only imperfectly the
animus which was now coming more and more to control the impeachers. Fortunately, however, there was one man among the President's advisers
who was ready to carry the whole antijudicial program as far as
possible. This uncompromising opponent was William Branch Giles, Senator
from Virginia,
4532 Melissa Forge Apt. 516
North Shanemouth, KY 31052
 whose views on the subject of impeachment were taken down
by John Quincy Adams just as Chase's trial was about to open. Giles,
according to this record, ""treated with the utmost contempt the idea of
an independent judiciary--said there was not a word about their
independence in the Constitution.... The power of impeachment was given
without limitation to the House of Representatives; the power of trying
impeachment was given equally without limitation to the Senate; and if
the Judges of the Supreme Court should dare, as they had done, to
declare an act of Congress unconstitutional, or to send a mandamus to
the Secretary of State, as they had done, it was the unreserved right of
the House of Representatives to impeach them, and that of the Senate to
remove them, for giving such opinions, however, honest or sincere they
may have been in entertaining them."" For ""impeachment was not a criminal
prosecution, it was no prosecution at all."" It only signified that the
impeached officer held dangerous opinions and that his office ought to
be in better hands. ""I perceive,"" adds Adams, on his own account, ""that
the impeachment system is to be pursued, and the whole bench of the
Supreme Court to be swept away, because their offices are

"And in
the present state of things I am convinced it is as easy for Mr. John
Randolph and Mr. Giles
01192 Martinez Freeway Apt. 321
Lake Jenniferfort, NV 03624
 to do this as to say it."" The trial formally opened on January 2, 1805, though the taking of
testimony did not begin until the 9th of February. A contemporary
description of the Senate chamber shows that the apostles of Republican
simplicity, with the pomp of the Warren Hastings trial still fresh in
mind, were not at all averse to making the scene as impressive as
possible by the use of several different colors of cloth: ""On the right
and left of the President of the Senate, and in a right line with his
chair, there are two rows of benches with desks in front, and the whole
front and seats covered with crimson cloth.... A temporary semi-circular
gallery, which consists of three ranges of benches, is elevated on
pillars and the whole front and seats thereof covered with green
cloth.... In this gallery ladies are accommodated.... On the right and
left hand of the President ... are two boxes of two rows of seats ...
that facing the President's right is occupied by the managers ... that
on the other side of the bar for the accused and his counsel ... these
boxes are covered with blue cloth."" To preside over
USCGC Baxter
FPO AE 36735
 this scene of
somewhat dubious splendor came Aaron Burr, Vice-President of the United
States, straight from the dueling ground at Weehawken. The occasion brought forward one of the most extraordinary men of the
day, Luther Martin, Chase's friend and the leader of his counsel. Born
at New Brunswick, New Jersey, in 1744, Martin graduated from Princeton
in 1766, the first of a class of thirty-five, among whom was Oliver
Ellsworth. Five years later he began to practice law on the Eastern
Shore of Maryland and in the adjoining counties of Virginia, where he
won an immediate success, especially in criminal cases. At a single term
of court, out of thirty defendants he procured the acquittal of
twenty-nine, while the thirtieth, indicted for murder, was convicted of
manslaughter. In 1805 Martin was the acknowledged head of the American
Bar, but at the same time he was undoubtedly a drunkard and

"With an income of $10,000 a year, he was always in need. His mediocre stature, thinning locks, and undistinguished features
created an impression which was confirmed by his slovenly attire and
ungrammatical speech, which seemed ""shackled by a preternatural
secretion of saliva."" Here, indeed, for ugliness and caustic tongue

 was
""the Thersites of the law."" Yet once he was roused to action, his great
resources made themselves apparent: a memory amounting to genius, a
boyish delight in the rough-and-tumble of combat, a wealth of passion,
kept in perfect curb till the enemy was already

Gonzalezland, TN 11289
 in rout before solid
argument and then let loose with destroying effect. This child of nature
was governed in his practice of the law less by retainers than by his
personal loves and hatreds. Samuel Chase he loved and Thomas Jefferson
he hated, and though his acquaintance with criminals had furnished him
with a vituperative vocabulary of some amplitude, he considered no other
damnation quite so scathing as to call a man ""as great a scoundrel as
Tom Jefferson."" The impeachers had no one whom they could pit against this ""unprincipled
and impudent Federalist bulldog,"" as Jefferson called him; and in other
ways, too, from the first their lot was not easy. For one thing, they
could not agree among themselves as to the proper scope of impeachment
under the Constitution. Randolph, the leader of the House managers, and
Campbell adhered in essence to Giles's theory. But Rodney and Nicholson,
both much abler lawyers, openly disavowed such latitudinarian

 doctrine."|('09494 Sellers Falls Apt. 537\nKeithburgh, IL 16661', '83870 Riley Mountain\nGonzalezland, TN 11289', '553 Heather Pike\nSchmidtland, MT 63643')
"In a general way, their view of the matter may be stated thus: Because
judges of the United States are guaranteed continuance in office only
during ""good behavior,"" and because impeachment is the only method of
removal recognized by the Constitution, the ""high crimes and
misdemeanors"" for which impeachment is the constitutional resource must
include all cases of willful misconduct in office, whether indictable or
not. This seems sound theory and appears today to be established theory. But sound or not, the managers of the Republicans were not a unit in
urging
Unit 6943 Box 8554
DPO AE 22467
 it, while their opponents put forward with confidence and
unanimity the theory that ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" were always
indictable offenses. More calamitous still for the accusers of Chase was the way in which,
when the evidence began to come in, the case against him started
crumpling at the corners. Lewis, who had been Fries's attorney and whose
testimony they had chiefly relied upon to prove the judge's unfairness
on that occasion, had not only acknowledged that his memory was ""not
very tenacious"" after so great a lapse of time but had further admitted
that he had really dropped the case because he thought it ""more likely
that the President would pardon him [Fries] after having been convicted
without having counsel than if he had."" Similarly Hay, whose repeated
efforts to bring the question
799 Gonzalez Lock Apt. 735
Graybury, GA 67815
 of the constitutionality of the Sedition
Act before the jury had caused the rupture between court and counsel in
Callender's case, owned that he had entertained ""but little hopes of
doing Callender any good"" but had ""wished to address the public on the
constitutionality of the law."" Sensations multiplied on every side. A
man named Heath testified that Chase had told the marshal to strike all
Democrats from the panel which was to try Callender; whereupon a second
witness called to confirm this testimony stated facts which showed the
whole story to be a deliberate fabrication. The story that Chase had
attacked the Administration at Baltimore was also substantially
disproved by the managers' own witnesses. But the climax of absurdity
was reached in the fifth and sixth articles of impeachment, which were
based on the assumption that an act of Congress had required the
procedure in Callender's case to be in accordance with the law

"In reply to this argument Chase's attorneys quickly pointed
out that the statute relied upon applied only to actions between
citizens of different States! The final arguments began on the 20th of February. The first speech in
behalf of Chase was delivered by Joseph Hopkinson, a young Philadelphia
attorney, whose effort stirred the admiration of Federalists and
Republicans alike. He dwelt upon ""the infinite
3513 Mary Estate Apt. 562
Nicolechester, MD 91108
 importance"" of the
implications of this case for the future of the Republic, contrasted the
frivolity of the charges brought against Chase with the magnitude of the
crimes of which Warren Hastings had been accused, and pointed out that,
whereas in England only two judges had been impeached in half a century,
in America, ""boasting of its superior purity and virtue,"" seven judges
had been prosecuted within two years. More loosely wrought, but not less
effective was Martin's address, the superb climax of a remarkable
forensic career! The accusation against Chase he reduced to a charge of
indecorum, and he was ready to admit that the manner of his friend ""bore
a stronger resemblance to that of Lord Thurlow than of Lord
Chesterfield,"" but, said he, our judges ought not to be ""like the gods
of Epicurus lolling upon their beds of down, equally careless whether
the laws of their country are obeyed or violated, instead of actively
discharging their duties."" The closing argument, which fell to the managers, was assigned to
Randolph. It was an unmitigated disaster for the cause in behalf of
which it was pronounced. ""I feel perfectly inadequate to the
5967 Miles Common
New Jacqueline, OH 92445
 task of
closing this important debate on account of a severe indisposition which
I labor under,"" were Randolph's opening words, but even this prefatory
apology gave little warning of the distressing exhibition of
incompetence which was to follow. ""On the reopening of the court,""
records John Quincy Adams in his Memoirs, ""he [Randolph] began a speech
of about two hours and a half, with as little relation to the
subject-matter as possible ... without order, connection, or argument;
consisting altogether of the most hackneyed commonplaces of popular
declamation, mingled up with panegyrics and invectives upon persons,
with a few well-expressed ideas, a few striking figures, much distortion
of face and contortion of body, tears, groans and sobs, with occasional

"So ended the ambition of John Randolph of Roanoke to prove
himself another Burke! But while their frontal assault on the reason of the court was thus
breaking down, the impeachers, led by the President, were attempting a
flank movement on its virtue. They especially distrusted the
""steadiness""

 of certain New England and New York Senators and hoped to
reach the hearts of these gentlemen through Aaron Burr, the
Vice-President. Burr had heretofore found himself vested with the rôle
of Lucifer in the Republican Paradise. Now he found himself suddenly
basking in a perpetual sunburst of smiles both from the great central
luminary, Jefferson, and his paler satellites, Madison and Gallatin. Invitations to the President's dinners were soon followed by more
substantial bribes. Burr's step-son became judge of the Superior Court
at New Orleans;
869 Chapman Throughway Suite 515
East Brian, VT 24725
 his brother-in-law, secretary to the Louisiana
Territory; his intimate friend Wilkinson, its military commandant. Then
Giles, whose view of impeachment left him utterly shameless in the
matter, drew up and circulated in the Senate itself a petition to the
Governor of New Jersey asking him to quash the indictment for murder
which the Bergen County grand jury had found against Burr as a result of
the duel with Hamilton. At the same time, an act was passed giving the
retiring Vice-President the franking privilege for life. In the debate
Senator Wright of Maryland declared that dueling was justified by the
example of David and Goliath and that the bill was opposed ""only because
our David had slain the Goliath of

"Whether Burr made any attempt to render the expected quid
4492 Henderson Walks
Lake Meganport, MD 40757
 pro quo for
these favors does not appear, but at least if he did, his efforts were
fruitless. The vote on the impeachment of Chase was taken on the 1st of
March, and the impeachers were crushingly defeated. On the first article
they could muster only sixteen votes out of thirty-four; on the second,
only ten; on the fifth, none; on the sixth, four. Even on the last
article, where they made their best showing, they were still four votes
short of the required constitutional majority. When the result of the
last ballot was announced, Randolph rushed from the Senate chamber to
the House to introduce a resolution proposing an amendment to the
Constitution, requiring that judges of the United States ""shall be
removed by the President on joint address of both Houses of Congress."" At the same time Nicholson moved an amendment providing legislative
recall for Senators. Thus exasperation was vented and no harm done. Meanwhile word had come from Philadelphia that the impeachment of the
State Supreme Court judges had also failed. Here, even more impressively
than in the case of Chase, had been illustrated that solidarity of Bench
and Bar which has ever since been such an influential factor in American
government. The Pennsylvania judge-breakers, failing to induce a single
reputable member of the Philadelphia bar to aid them, had been obliged
to go to Delaware, whence they procured Cæsar A. Rodney, one of the

"The two impeachments were thus closely
connected and their results were similar. In the first place, it was
determined that impeachment was likely to be, in the petulant language
of Jefferson, ""a farce"" not soon to be used again for partisan purposes. In the second place, it was probable that henceforth, in the
Commonwealths as well as in the National Government, political power
would be exercised subject to constitutional restraints applied
judicially. In the third place, however, the judges would henceforth
have to be content with the

and dispense with all judicial homilies on ""manners and morals."" It was

The Trial Of Aaron Burr

When, on March 30, 1807, Colonel Aaron Burr, late Vice-President of the
United States, was brought before Chief Justice Marshall in the Eagle
Tavern at Richmond on the charge of treason, there began the greatest
criminal trial in American history and one of the notable trials in the
annals of the law. ""The Burr Conspiracy"" still remains after a hundred years an unsolved
enigma. Yet whether Burr actually planned treason against the United
States in the year of grace 1806 is after all a question of somewhat
restricted importance. The essential truth is that he was by nature an
adventurer who, in the words of Hamilton, ""believed all things possible
to daring and energy,"" and that in 1806 he was a bankrupt and a social
outcast to boot. Whether, therefore, his grandiose project of an empire
on the ruins of Spanish dominion in Mexico involved also an effort to
separate some part of the West from the Union is a question which, if it
was ever definitely determined in Burr's own mind, was determined, we
may be sure, quite independently of any moral or
6659 Wilson Fork Apt. 329
Anthonyhaven, HI 16382
 patriotic
considerations."|('Unit 5265 Box 9493\nDPO AP 03279', 'USCGC Clayton\nFPO AP 10609', '6659 Wilson Fork Apt. 329\nAnthonyhaven, HI 16382')
"Burr's activities after his term of public office ended in March, 1805,
were devious, complicated, and purposely veiled, involving many men and
spread over a large territory. ¹ Near Marietta on an island in the Ohio
River, Burr came upon Harman Blennerhassett, a genial Irishman living in
a luxurious and hospitable mansion which was making a heavy drain upon
his already diminished resources. Here Burr, by his charm of manner and
engaging conversation, soon won from the simple Irishman
414 Lisa Greens Apt. 797
Joneshaven, HI 32655
 his heart and
his remaining funds. He also made the island both a convenient
rendezvous for his adherents in his ambitious schemes and a starting
point for his own extended expeditions, which took him during the latter
part of this year to Natchez, Nashville, St. Louis, Vincennes,
Cincinnati, and Philadelphia, and back to Washington. ¹ An account of the Burr conspiracy will be found in Jefferson and his
Colleagues, by Allen Johnson (in The Chronicles of America). In the summer of 1806 Burr turned westward a second time and with the
assistance of Blennerhassett he began military preparations on the
latter's island for a mysterious expedition. On the 29th of July, Burr
had dispatched a letter in cipher to Wilkinson, his most important
confederate. The precise terms of this document we shall never know, but
apparently it contained the most amazing claims of the successful
maturing of Burr's scheme: ""funds had been obtained,"" ""English naval
protection had been secured,"" ""from five hundred to a thousand men""
would be on the move down the Mississippi by the middle of November. Unfortunately for Burr, however, Wilkinson was far too expert in the
usages of iniquity to be taken in by such audacious lying as this. He
guessed that the enterprise was on the verge of collapse and forthwith
made up his mind to abandon
66362 Thomas Squares
Staffordport, SD 13442
 it."|('414 Lisa Greens Apt. 797\nJoneshaven, HI 32655', '66362 Thomas Squares\nStaffordport, SD 13442')
"Meanwhile exaggerated accounts of the size of Burr's following were
filtering to Washington, together with circumstantial rumors of the
disloyalty of his designs. Yet for weeks Jefferson did nothing, until
late in November his alarm was aroused by a letter from Wilkinson, dated
the 21st of October. On the 27th of November the President issued a
proclamation calling upon all good citizens to seize ""sundry persons""
who were charged with
87157 Nguyen Turnpike
North Ryanhaven, LA 71677
 setting on foot a military expedition against
Spain. Already Burr, realizing that the West was not so hot for disunion
as perhaps he had supposed it to be, began to represent his project as a
peaceful emigration to the Washita, a precaution which, however, came
too late to allay the rising excitement of the people. Fearing the
seizure of their equipment, thirty or forty of Burr's followers under
the leadership of Blennerhassett left the island in four or five
flatboats for New Orleans, on the night of the 10th of December, and a
few days later were joined by Burr himself at the mouth of the
Cumberland. When the little expedition paused near Natchez, on the 10th
of January, Burr was confronted with a newspaper containing a
transcription of his fatal letter to Wilkinson. A week later, learning
that his former ally, Wilkinson, had now established a reign of terror
at New Orleans directed against his followers, and feeling no desire to
test the tender mercies of a court-martial presided over by his former
associate, Burr surrendered himself into the custody of the acting
Governor of Mississippi Territory. But the refusal of the territorial
grand jury to indict him suggested the hope that he might still escape
from the reach of the law. He therefore plunged into the wilderness,
headed for the Spanish border, and had all but reached his destination
when he was recognized and recaptured at Wakefield, Alabama. Owing to the peculiar and complicated circumstances which led up to it,
Burr's case was from the outset imbued with factional and partisan
politics of the most extreme
4071 James Landing
West William, CT 10551
 kind."|('87157 Nguyen Turnpike\nNorth Ryanhaven, LA 71677', '4071 James Landing\nWest William, CT 10551')
"While the conspiracy was at its
height, Jefferson, though emphatically warned, had refused to lend it
any credence whatever; but when the danger was well over he had thrown
the whole country into a panic, and had even asked Congress to suspend
the writ of habeas corpus. The Federalists and the President's enemies
within his own party, headed by the redoubtable Randolph, were instantly
alert to the opportunity which Jefferson's inexplicable conduct afforded
them. ""The mountain had labored and brought forth a mouse,"" quoted the
supercilious; the executive dragnet had descended to envelop the monster
which was ready to split the Union or at least to embroil its relations
with a friendly power, and had brought up--a few peaceful
agriculturists! Nor was this the worst of the matter, contended these
critics of the Administration,
5519 Tina Manors Suite 411
West Melissa, MD 44641
 for the real source of the peril had been
the President's own action in assigning the command at New Orleans to
Wilkinson, a pensioner of Spain, a villain ""from the bark to the very
core."" Yet so far was the President from admitting this error that he
now attributed the salvation of the country to ""the soldier's honor"" and
""the citizen's fidelity"" of this same Wilkinson. Surely, then, the real
defendants before the bar of opinion were Thomas Jefferson and his
precious ally James Wilkinson, not their harried and unfortunate victim,
Aaron Burr! The proceedings against Burr occupied altogether some seven months,
during which the sleepy little town of Richmond became the cynosure of
all eyes. So famous was the case that it brought thither of necessity or
out of curiosity men of every rank and grade of life, of every species
of renown. The prosecution was in charge of the United States District
Attorney, George Hay--serious, humorless, faithful to Jefferson's
interests, and absolutely devoid of the personal authority demanded by
so grave a cause. He was assisted by William Wirt, already a brilliant
lawyer and possessed of a dazzling elocution, but sadly lacking in the
majesty of
553 Joseph Dam

 years."|('5519 Tina Manors Suite 411\nWest Melissa, MD 44641', '553 Joseph Dam\nEast Gregory, UT 91305')
"At the head and forefront of the defense stood Burr
himself, an unerring legal
839 Hernandez Pass Suite 290
Lunatown, ID 66880
 tactician, deciding every move of the great
game, the stake of which for him was life itself. About him were
gathered the ablest members of the Richmond bar: John Wickham, witty and
ingenious, Edmund Randolph, ponderous and pontifical, Benjamin Botts,
learned and sarcastic, while from Baltimore came Luther Martin to aid
his ""highly respected friend,"" to keep the political pot boiling, and
eventually to fall desperately in love with Burr's daughter, the
beautiful Theodosia. Among the 140 witnesses there were also some
notable figures: William Eaton, the hero of Derne, whom Burr's
codefendant, Blennerhassett, describes for us as ""strutting about the
streets under a tremendous hat, with a Turkish sash over colored
clothes,"" and offering up, with his frequent libations in the taverns,
""the copious effusions of his sorrows""; Commodore Truxton, the gallant
commander of the Constellation; General Andrew Jackson, future President
of the United States, but now a vehement declaimer of Burr's
innocence--out of abundant caution for his own reputation, it may be
surmised;
2972 Michael Fork Apt. 457
Briggsland, IL 29540
 Erick Bollmann, once a participant in the effort to release
Lafayette from Olmutz and himself just now released from durance vile on
a writ of habeas corpus from the Supreme Court; Samuel Swartwout,
another tool of Burr's, reserved by the same beneficent writ for a
career of political roguery which was to culminate in his swindling the
Government out of a million and a quarter dollars; and finally the
bibulous and traitorous Wilkinson, ""whose head"" as he himself owned,
""might err,"" but ""whose heart could not deceive."" Traveling by packet
from New Orleans, this essential witness was heralded by the impatient
prosecution, till at last he burst upon the stage with all the éclat of
the hero in a melodrama--only to retire baffled and perplexed, his
villainy guessed by his own partisans. By the Constitution treason against the United States consists ""only in
levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them
aid and comfort,"" and no person may be convicted of it ""unless on the
testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in
open court."" The motion to commit Burr for treason thus raised at the
outset the question whether in this case an ""overt act"" existed. Marshall, who held that no evidence had been shown to this effect,
denied the motion, but consented to commit the prisoner on the lesser
charge that he had attempted a military expedition against Spain. As
this was a bailable offense, however, Burr was soon at liberty once
more. Nor was this the only respect in which the preliminary proceedings
sounded a note of antagonism between the Chief Justice and the
Administration which was to recur again and yet again in the months
following. Only a few weeks earlier at Washington, Marshall had, though
with some apparent reluctance, ordered the release of Bollmann and
Swartwout, two of Burr's tools, from the custody of the
PSC 7917, Box 7993

authorities."|('839 Hernandez Pass Suite 290\nLunatown, ID 66880', '2972 Michael Fork Apt. 457\nBriggsland, IL 29540', 'PSC 7917, Box 7993\nAPO AA 56502')
"Alluding in his present opinion to his reason for his
earlier action, he wrote: ""More than five weeks have elapsed since the
opinion of the Supreme Court has declared the necessity of proving the
fact,
9862 Simpson Ramp
Jillport, LA 86865
 if it exists. Why is it not proved? To the executive government is
entrusted the important power of prosecuting those whose crimes may
disturb the public repose or endanger its safety. It would be easy, in
much less time than has intervened since Colonel Burr has been alleged
to have assembled his troops, to procure affidavits establishing the
fact."" This sharp criticism brought an equally sharp retort from Jefferson, to
which was added a threat. In a private
57825 Ferguson Light Suite 360
Lake Jose, NC 66468
 letter of the 20th of April, the
President said: ""In what terms of decency can we speak of this? As if an
express could go to Natchez or the mouth of the Cumberland and return in
five weeks, to do which has never taken less than twelve!... But all the
principles of law are to be perverted which would bear on the favorite
offenders who endeavor to overturn this odious republic!... All this,
however, will work well. The nation will judge both the offender and
judges for
2787 Gary Streets Apt. 834

"They will see then and amend the error in our
Constitution which makes any branch independent of the nation.... If
their [the judges] protection of Burr produces this amendment, it will
do more good than his condemnation would have done."" Already the case
had taken on the color of a fresh contest between the President and the
Chief Justice. On the 22d of May the United States Court for the Fifth Circuit and the
Virginia District formally convened, with Marshall presiding and Judge
Griffin at his side. On the same day the grand jury was sworn, with John
Randolph as foreman, and presently began taking testimony. Unluckily for
the prosecution, the proceedings now awaited the arrival of Wilkinson
and the delay was turned to skillful use by the defense to embroil
further the relations between the Chief Justice and the President. With
this end in view, Burr moved on the 9th of June that a subpœna duces
tecum issue to Jefferson requiring him to produce certain papers,
including the famous cipher letter to Wilkinson. The main question
involved, of course, was that of the right of the Court under any
circumstances to issue a subpœna to the President, but the abstract
issue soon became involved with a much more irritating personal one. ""This,"" said Luther Martin, who now found himself in his element, ""this
is a peculiar case, sir. The President has undertaken to prejudge my
client by declaring that 'of his guilt there is no doubt.'"|()
"He has
assumed to himself the knowledge of the Supreme Being himself and
pretended
6771 Melissa Views Apt. 635
New Jacobview, FL 79209
 to search the heart of my highly respected friend. He has
proclaimed him a traitor in the face of the country which has rewarded
him. He has let slip the dogs of war, the hell-hounds of persecution, to
hunt down my friend. And would this President of the United States, who
has raised all this absurd clamor, pretend to keep back the papers which
are wanted for this trial, where life itself is at stake?"" Wirt's answer to Martin was also a rebuke to the Court. ""Do they [the
defense] flatter themselves,"" he asked, ""that this court feel political
prejudices which will supply the place of argument and innocence on the
part of the prisoner? Their conduct amounts to an insinuation of the
sort. But I do not believe it.... Sir, no man, foreigner or citizen, who
hears this language addressed to the court, and received with all the
complacency at least which silence can imply, can make any inference
from it very honorable to the court."" These words touched Marshall's
conscience, as well they might. At the close of the day he asked counsel
henceforth to ""confine themselves to the point really before the
court""--a request which, however, was by no means invariably observed
through the following

 days."|('6771 Melissa Views Apt. 635\nNew Jacobview, FL 79209', '7548 Ashley Row\nSouth Aprilborough, WY 81171')
"A day or two later Marshall ruled that the subpœna should issue, holding
that neither the personal nor the official character of the President
exempted him from the operation of that constitutional clause which
guarantees accused persons ""compulsory process for obtaining witnesses""
in their behalf. The demand made upon the President, said the Chief
Justice, by his official duties is not an unremitting one, and, ""if it
should exist at the time when his attendance on a court is required, it
would be sworn on the return of the subpœna and would rather constitute
a reason for not obeying the process of the court than a reason against
its being issued."" Jefferson, however, neither obeyed
03255 Wolf Ranch
Michaelborough, MT 15439
 the writ nor swore
anything on its return, though he forwarded some of the papers required
to Hay, the district attorney, to be used as the latter might deem best. The President's argument was grounded on the mutual independence of the
three departments of Government; and he asked whether the independence
of the Executive could long survive ""if the smaller
882 Ward Lodge
Lake Morgan, HI 66614
 courts could bandy
him from pillar to post, keep him constantly trudging from North to
South and East to West, and withdraw him entirely from his executive
duties?"" The President had the best of the encounter on all scores. Not
only had Marshall forgotten for the nonce the doctrine he himself had
stated in Marbury vs. Madison regarding the constitutional discretion of
the Executive, but what was worse still, he had forgotten his own
discretion on that occasion. He had fully earned his rebuff, but that
fact did not appreciably sweeten it. On the 24th of June the grand jury reported two indictments against
Burr, one for treason and the other for misdemeanor. The former charged
that Burr, moved thereto ""by the instigation of the devil,"" had on the
10th of December previous levied war against the United States at
Blennerhassett's island, in the county of Wood, of the District of
Virginia, and had on the day following, at the same place, set in motion
a warlike array against the city of New Orleans. The latter charged that
a further purpose of this same warlike array was an invasion of

"Treason not being a bailable offense,
977 Katherine Plains

 Burr had now to go to jail, but,
as the city jail was alleged to be unhealthful, the Court allowed him to
be removed to quarters which had been proffered by the Governor of the
State in the penitentiary just outside the city. Burr's situation here,
writes his biographer, ""was extremely agreeable. He had a suite of rooms
in the third story, extending one hundred feet, where he was allowed to
see his friends without the presence of a witness. His rooms were so
thronged with visitors

bringing oranges, lemons, pineapples, raspberries, apricots, cream,
butter, ice, and other articles--presents from the ladies of the city. In expectation of his daughter's arrival, some of his friends in town
provided a house for her accommodation. The jailer, too, was all
civility."" ¹ Little wonder that such goings-on are said to have ""filled
the measure of Jefferson's disgust."" ¹ Parton's Life and Times of Aaron Burr (13th Edition, N. Y., 1860), p.

"The first business
in hand was to get a jury which would answer to the constitutional
requirement of impartiality--a task which it was soon discovered was
likely to prove a difficult one. The original panel of forty-eight men
contained only four who had not expressed opinions unfavorable to the
prisoner, and of these four all but one admitted some degree of
prejudice against him. These four were nevertheless accepted as jurors. A second panel was then summoned which was even more unpromising in its
make-up, and Burr's counsel began hinting that the trial would have to
be quashed, when Burr himself arose and offered to select eight out of
the whole venire to add to the four previously chosen. The offer was
accepted, and notwithstanding that several of the jurors thus obtained
had publicly declared opinions hostile to the accused, the jury was
sworn in on the 17th of August. At first glance Burr's concession in the selecting of a jury seems
extraordinary. But then, why should one so confident of being able to
demonstrate his innocence fear prejudice which rested on no firmer basis
than ignorance of the facts? This reflection, however, probably played
small part in Burr's calculations, for already he knew that if the
contemplated strategy of his counsel prevailed the case would never come
before the jury. The first witness called by the prosecution was Eaton, who was prepared
to recount the substance of numerous conversations he had held with Burr
in Washington in the winter of 1805-6, in which Burr had gradually
unveiled to him the treasonable character of his project. No sooner,
however, was Eaton sworn than the defense entered the objection that his
testimony was not yet relevant, contending that in a prosecution for
treason the great material fact on which the merits of the entire
controversy pivots was the overt act, which must be ""an open act of
war""; just as in a murder trial the fact of the killing, the corpus
delicti, must be proved before any other testimony was relevant, so in
the pending prosecution, said they, no testimony was admissible until
the overt act had been shown in the manner required by the
8270 Melissa Knoll Apt. 430
Deanton, MI 48862
 Constitution."|('8270 Melissa Knoll Apt. 430\nDeanton, MI 48862',)
"The task of answering this argument
2518 Hubbard Plaza Apt. 369
New Ashleyfurt, VT 43048
 fell to Wirt, who argued, and
apparently with justice, that the prosecution was free to introduce its
evidence in any order it saw fit, provided only that the evidence was
relevant to the issue raised by the indictment, and that if an overt act
was proved ""in the course of the whole evidence,"" that would be
sufficient. The day following the Court read an opinion which is a model
of ambiguous and equivocal statement, but the purport was fairly clear:
for the moment the Court would not interfere, and the prosecution was
free to proceed as it thought best, with the warning that the Damocles
sword of ""irrelevancy"" was suspended over its head by the barest thread
and might fall at any moment. For the next two days the legal battle was kept in abeyance while the
taking of testimony went forward. Eaton was followed on the stand by
Commodore Truxton, who stated that in conversation with him Burr had
seemed to be aiming only at an expedition against Mexico. Then came
General Morgan and his two sons, who asserted their belief in the
treasonable character of Burr's designs. Finally a series of witnesses,
the majority of them servants of Blennerhassett, testified that on the
evening of December 10, 1806, Burr's forces had assembled on the island. This line of testimony concluded, the prosecution next indicated
PSC 7614, Box 4312
APO AP 58746
 its
intention of introducing evidence to show Burr's connection with the
assemblage on the island, when the defense sprang the coup it had been
maturing from the outset. Pointing out the notorious fact that on the
night of the 10th of December Burr had not been present at the island
but had been two hundred miles away in Kentucky, they contended that,
under the Constitution, the assemblage on Blennerhassett's island could
not be regarded as his act, even granting that he had advised it, for,
said they, advising war is one thing but levying it is quite another. If
this interpretation was correct, then no overt act of levying war,
either within the jurisdiction of the Court or stated in the indictment,
had been, or could be, shown against Burr. Hence the taking of
evidence--if not the cause itself, indeed--should be discontinued."|('2518 Hubbard Plaza Apt. 369\nNew Ashleyfurt, VT 43048', 'PSC 7614, Box 4312\nAPO AP 58746')
"The legal question raised by this argument was the comparatively simple
one whether the constitutional provision regarding treason was to be
interpreted in the light of the Common Law doctrine that ""in treason all
are principals."" For if it were to be so interpreted and if Burr's
connection with the general conspiracy culminating in the assemblage was
demonstrable
335 Hill Turnpike
East Kathleen, AZ 99489
 by any sort of legal evidence, then the assemblage was his
act, his overt act, proved moreover by thrice the two witnesses
constitutionally required! Again it fell to Wirt to represent the
prosecution, and he discharged his task most brilliantly. He showed
beyond peradventure that the Common Law doctrine was grounded upon
unshakable authority; that, considering the fact that the entire
phraseology of the constitutional clause regarding treason comes from an
English statute of Edward III's time, it was reasonable, if not
indispensable, to construe it in the light of the Common Law; and that,
certainly as to a procurer of treason, such as Burr was charged with
being, the Common Law doctrine was the only just doctrine, being merely
a reaffirmation of the even more ancient principle that ""what one does
through another, he does himself."" In elaboration of this last point Wirt launched forth upon that famous
passage in which he contrasted Burr and the pathetic victim of his
conspiracy:

Who [he asked] is Blennerhassett? A native of Ireland, a man of letters,
who fled from the storms of his own country to find quiet in ours....
Possessing himself of a beautiful island in the Ohio he rears upon it a
palace and decorates it with every romantic embellishment of fancy. [Then] in the midst of all this peace, this innocent simplicity, this
pure banquet of the heart, the destroyer comes ... to change this
paradise into a hell.... By degrees he infuses [into the heart of
Blennerhassett] the poison of his own ambition.... In a short time the
whole man is changed, and every object of his former delight is
relinquished.... His books are abandoned.... His enchanted island is
destined soon to relapse into a wilderness; and in a few months we find
the beautiful and tender partner of his bosom, whom he lately 'permitted
not the winds of summer to visit too roughly,' we find her shivering at
midnight on the winter banks of the Ohio and mingling her tears with the
torrents that froze as they fell. Yet this unfortunate man, thus ruined,
and undone and made to play a subordinate part in this grand drama of
guilt and treason, this man is to be called the principal offender,
while he by whom he was thus plunged in misery is comparatively
innocent, a mere accessory! Sir, neither the human heart nor the human understanding will bear a
perversion so monstrous and absurd!"|('335 Hill Turnpike\nEast Kathleen, AZ 99489',)
"But there was one human heart, one human understanding--and that, in
ordinary circumstances, a very good one--which was quite willing to
shoulder just such a monstrous perversion, or at least its equivalent,
and that heart was John Marshall's. The discussion of the motion to
arrest the evidence continued ten days, most of the time being occupied
by
7696 Salinas Station
Port Kevin, AK 13039
 Burr's attorneys. ¹ Finally, on the last day of the month, the Chief
Justice handed down an opinion accepting practically the whole
contention of Burr's attorneys, but offering a totally new set of
reasons for it. On the main question at issue, namely, whether under the
Constitution all involved in a treasonable enterprise are principals,
Marshall pretended not to pass; but in fact he rejected the essential
feature of the Common Law doctrine, namely, the necessary legal presence
at the scene of action of all parties to the conspiracy. The crux of his
argument he embodied in the following statement: ""If in one case the
presence of the individual make the guilt of the [treasonable]
assemblage his guilt, and in the other case, the procurement by the
individual make the guilt of the [treasonable] assemblage, his guilt,
then presence and procurement are equally component parts of the overt
act, and equally require two witnesses."" Unfortunately for this
argument, the Constitution does not require that the ""component parts""
of the overt act be proved by two witnesses, but only that the overt
act--the corpus delicti--be so proved; and for the simple reason that,
when by further evidence any particular individual is connected with the
treasonable combination which brought about the overt act, that act,
assuming the Common Law doctrine, becomes his act, and he is accordingly
responsible for it at the place where it occurred. Burr's attorneys
admitted this contention unreservedly. Indeed, that was precisely the
reason why they had opposed the Common Law doctrine. ¹ A recurrent feature of their arguments was a denunciation of
""constructive treason."" But this was mere
Unit 0965 Box 8428
DPO AE 81887
 declamation."|('7696 Salinas Station\nPort Kevin, AK 13039', 'Unit 0965 Box 8428\nDPO AE 81887')
"Nobody was
charging Burr with any sort of treason except that which is specifically
defined by the Constitution itself, namely, the levying of war against
the United States. The only question at issue was as to the method of
proof by which this crime may be validly established in the case of one
accused of procuring treason. There was also much talk about the danger
and injustice of dragging a man from one end of the country to stand
trial for an act committed at the other end of it. The answer was that,
if
Unit 4451 Box 6482
DPO AE 67357
 the man himself procured the act or joined others in bringing it
about, he ought to stand trial where the act occurred. This same
""injustice"" may happen today in the case of murder! Marshall's effort to steer between this doctrine and its obvious
consequences for the case before him placed him, therefore, in the
curious position of demanding that two overt acts be proved each by two
witnesses. But if two, why not twenty? For it must often happen that the
traitor's connection with the overt act is demonstrable not by a single
act but a series of acts. Furthermore, in the case of procurers of
treason, this connection will ordinarily not appear in overt acts at all
but, as in Burr's own case, will be covert. Can it be, then, that the
Constitution is chargeable with the absurdity of regarding the procurers
of treason as traitors and yet of making their conviction
37172 Nguyen Alley Suite 499
South Lesliemouth, MD 77429
 impossible?"|('Unit 4451 Box 6482\nDPO AE 67357', '37172 Nguyen Alley Suite 499\nSouth Lesliemouth, MD 77429')
"The fact of the matter was that six months earlier, before his attitude
toward Burr's doings had begun to take color from his hatred and
distrust of Jefferson, Marshall had entertained no doubt that the Common
Law doctrine underlay the constitutional definition of treason. Speaking
for the Supreme Court in the case of Bollmann and Swartwout, he had
said: ""It is not the intention of the Court to say that no individual
can
Unit 3467 Box 7256
DPO AP 13101
 be guilty of this crime who has not appeared in arms against his
country; on the contrary, if war be actually levied, that is, if a body
of men be actually assembled for the purpose of effecting by force a
treasonable purpose, all those
635 Lori Row Suite 161
Anthonyburgh, AK 13346
 who perform any part however minute, or
however remote from the scene of action, and who are actually leagued in
the general conspiracy, are to be considered traitors."" Marshall's
effort to square this previous opinion with his later position was as
unconvincing as it was labored. ¹

¹ The way in which Marshall proceeded to do this was to treat the phrase
""perform a part"" as demanding ""a levying of war"" on the part of the
performer. (Robertson, Reports, vol. But this explanation
will not hold water. For what then becomes of the phrase ""scene of
action"" in the passage just quoted? What is the difference between the
part to be performed ""however minute,"" and the ""action"" from which the
performer may be ""however remote""? It is perfectly evident that the
""action"" referred to is the assemblage which is regarded as the overt
act of war, and that the ""part however minute"" is something very
different. Burr's attorneys were more prudent: they dismissed Marshall's earlier
words outright as obiter dicta--and erroneous at
395 Wilson Knoll
Lake Ambertown, OK 27363
 that!"|('Unit 3467 Box 7256\nDPO AP 13101', '635 Lori Row Suite 161\nAnthonyburgh, AK 13346', '395 Wilson Knoll\nLake Ambertown, OK 27363')
"Nevertheless
when, thirty years later, Story, Marshall's friend and pupil, was in
search of the best judicial definition of treason within the meaning of
the Constitution, he selected this sentence from the case of Bollmann
and Swartwout and passed by the elaborate opinion in Burr's case in
significant silence. But reputation is a great magician in transmuting
heresy into accepted teaching. Posthumously Marshall's opinion has
attained a rank and authority with the legal profession that it never
enjoyed in his own time. Regarding it, therefore, as today established
doctrine, we may say that it has quite reversed the relative importance
of conspiracy and overt act where the treason is by levying war. At the
Common Law, and in the view of the framers of the Constitution, the
importance of the overt act of war was to make the conspiracy visible,
to put its existence beyond surmise. By Marshall's view each traitor is
chargeable only with his own overt acts, and the conspiracy is of
importance merely as showing the intention of such acts. And from this
it results logically, as Marshall saw, though he did not venture to say
so explicitly, that the procurer of treason is not a traitor unless he
has also participated personally in an overt act of war. As Wirt very
justifiably contended, such a result is ""monstrous,"" and, what is more,
it has not been possible to adhere to it in practice. In recent
legislation necessitated by the Great War, Congress has restored the old
Common Law view of treason but has avoided the constitutional difficulty
by labeling the offense ""Espionage."" Indeed, the Espionage Act of June
15, 1917, scraps Marshall's opinion pretty
540 Craig Motorway Suite 796

 completely."|('540 Craig Motorway Suite 796\nEast James, KY 64185',)
"¹

¹ See especially Title I, Section 4, of the Act. For evidence of the
modern standing of Marshall's opinion, see the chorus of approval
sounded by the legal fraternity in Dillon's three volumes. In support of
the Common Law doctrine, see the authorities cited in 27 Yale Law
Journal, p. 342 and footnotes; the chapter on Treason in Simon
Greenleaf's well-known Treatise on the Law of Evidence; United States
vs. Mitchell, 2 Dallas, 348; and Druecker vs. Salomon, 21 Wis., 621. On the day following the reading of Marshall's opinion, the prosecution,
unable to produce two witnesses who had actually seen Burr procure the
assemblage on the island, abandoned the case to the jury. Shortly
thereafter the following verdict
899 Maria Haven
Collierstad, LA 10816
 was returned: ""We of the jury say that
Aaron Burr is not proved to be guilty under this indictment by any
evidence submitted to us. We therefore find him not guilty."" At the
order of the Chief Justice this Scotch verdict was entered on the
records of the court as a simple Not Guilty. Marshall's conduct of Burr's trial for treason is the one serious
blemish in his judicial record, but for all that it was not without a
measure of extenuation. The President, too, had behaved deplorably and,
feeling himself on the defensive, had pressed matters with most unseemly
zeal, so that the charge of political persecution raised by Burr's
attorneys was, to say the least, not groundless. Furthermore, in
opposing the President in this matter, Marshall had shown his usual
political

 sagacity."|('899 Maria Haven\nCollierstad, LA 10816', '45988 Tara Mills\nRyanchester, VA 29465')
"Had Burr been convicted, the advantage must all have
gone to the Administration. The only possible credit the Chief Justice
could extract from the case would be from assuming that lofty tone of
calm, unmoved impartiality of which Marshall was such a master--and
never more than on this occasion--and from setting himself sternly
against popular hysteria. The words with which his opinion closes have
been often quoted:

Much has been said in the course
99407 Brian Isle Suite 316
Debbiemouth, WV 58933
 of the argument on points on which the
Court feels no inclination to comment particularly, but which may,
perhaps not improperly receive some notice. That this Court dare not usurp power is most true. That this Court dare not shrink from its duty is not less true. No man is desirous of placing himself in a disagreeable situation. No
man is desirous of becoming the popular subject of calumny. No man,
might he let the bitter cup pass from him without self-reproach, would
drain it to the bottom. But if he have no choice in the case, if there
be no alternative presented to him but a dereliction of duty or the
opprobrium of those who are denominated the world, he merits the
contempt as well as the indignation of his country who can hesitate
which to embrace. One could not require a better illustration of that faculty of
""apparently deep self-conviction"" which Wirt had noted in the Chi

Justice."|('99407 Brian Isle Suite 316\nDebbiemouth, WV 58933', '0268 April Key Suite 885\nSchaefermouth, ME 44816')
"Finally, it
PSC 6570, Box 9854
APO AP 09879
 must be owned that Burr's case offered Marshall a tempting
opportunity to try out the devotion of Republicans to that ideal of
judicial deportment which had led them so vehemently to criticize
Justice Chase and to charge him with being ""oppressive,"" with refusing
to give counsel for defense an opportunity to be heard, with
transgressing the state law of procedure, with showing too great liking
for Common Law ideas of sedition, with setting up the President as a
sort of monarch beyond the reach of judicial process. Marshall's conduct
of Burr's trial now exactly reversed every one of these grounds of
complaint. Whether he intended it or not, it was a neat turning of the
tables. But Jefferson, who was at once both the most theoretical and the least
logical of men, was of course hardly prepared to see matters
893 Andrew Shoals Apt. 051
Whiteshire, LA 52781
 in that
light. As soon as the news reached him of Burr's acquittal, he ordered
Hay to press the indictment for misdemeanor--not for the purpose of
convicting Burr, but of getting the evidence down in a form in which it
should be available for impeachment proceedings against Marshall. For
some weeks longer, therefore, the Chief Justice sat listening to
evidence which was to be used against himself. But the impeachment never
came, for a chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and the weakest
link in the combination against the Chief Justice was a very fragile one
indeed--the iniquitous Wilkinson. Even the faithful and melancholy Hay
finally abandoned him. ""The declaration which I made in court in his
favor some time ago,"" he wrote the President, ""was precipitate.... My
confidence in him is destroyed.... I am sorry for it, on his account, on
the public account, and because you have expressed opinions in
7814 Andrea Cape Apt. 004

favor."""|('PSC 6570, Box 9854\nAPO AP 09879', '893 Andrew Shoals Apt. 051\nWhiteshire, LA 52781', '7814 Andrea Cape Apt. 004\nEast Annestad, TN 44051')
"It was obviously impossible to impeach the Chief Justice for
having prevented the hanging of Aaron Burr on the testimony of such a
miscreant. Though the years immediately following the Burr trial were not a time of
conspicuous activity for Marshall, they paved the way in more than one
direction for his later achievement. Jefferson's retirement from the
Presidency at last relieved the Chief Justice from the warping influence
of a hateful personal contest and from anxiety for his official
security. Jefferson's successors were men more willing to identify the
cause of the Federal Judiciary with that of national unity. Better
still, the War of 1812 brought about the demise of the Federalist party
and thus cleared the Court of every suspicion of partisan bias. Henceforth the great political issue was the general one of the nature
of the Union and the Constitution, a field in which Marshall's talent
for debate made him master. In the meantime the Court was acquiring that
personnel
PSC 6077, Box 5030
APO AP 54470
 which it was to retain almost intact for nearly twenty years;
and, although the new recruits came from the ranks of his former party
foes, Marshall had little trouble in bringing their views into general
conformity with his own constitutional creed. Nor was his triumph an
exclusively personal one. He was aided in very large measure by the fact
that the war had brought particularism temporarily into discredit in all
sections of the country. Of Marshall's associates in 1812, Justice
Washington alone had come to the bench earlier, yet he was content to
speak through the mouth of his illustrious colleague, save on the
notable occasion when he led the only revolt of a majority of the Court
from the Chief Justice's leadership in the field of Constitutional Law."|('PSC 6077, Box 5030\nAPO AP 54470',)
"¹ Johnson of South Carolina, a man of no little personal vanity,
affected a greater independence, for which he was on one occasion warmly
congratulated by Jefferson; yet even his separate opinions, though they
sometimes challenge Marshall's more sweeping premises and bolder method
of reasoning, are after all mostly concurring ones. Marshall's really
invaluable aid among his associates was Joseph Story, who in 1811, at
the age of thirty-two, was appointed by Madison in succession
319 Juan Radial
Stevenport, AR 69766
 to
Cushing. Still immature, enthusiastically willing to learn, warmly
affectionate, and with his views on constitutional issues as yet
unformed, Story fell at once under the spell of Marshall's equally
gentle but vastly more resolute personality; and the result was one of
the most fruitful friendships
21579 Thomas Pines Suite 173
Jameschester, TX 68971
 of our history. Marshall's ""original
bias,"" to quote Story's own words, ""as well as the choice of his mind,
was to general principles and comprehensive views, rather than to
technical or recondite learning."" Story's own bias, which was supported
by his prodigious industry, was just the reverse. The two men thus
supplemented each other admirably. A tradition of some venerability
represents Story as having said that Marshall was wont to remark: ""Now
Story, that is the law; you find the precedents for it."" Whether true or
not, the tale at least illustrates the truth. Marshall owed to counsel a
somewhat similar debt in the way of leading up to his decisions, for, as
Story points out, ""he was solicitous to hear arguments and not to decide
cases without them, nor did any judge ever profit more by them."" But in
the field of Constitutional Law, at least, Marshall used counsel's
argument not so much to indicate what his own judicial goal ought to be
as to discover the best route thereto--often, indeed, through the
welcome stimulus which a clash of views gave to his reasoning

 powers."|('319 Juan Radial\nStevenport, AR 69766', '21579 Thomas Pines Suite 173\nJameschester, TX 68971', 'Unit 0857 Box 6781\nDPO AP 79484')
"¹ This was in the case of Ogden vs. Saunders, 12 Wheaton, 213 (1827). Though the wealth of available legal talent at this period was
impressively illustrated in connection both with Chase's impeachment and
with Burr's trial, yet on neither of these occasions appeared William
Pinkney of Maryland, the attorney to whom Marshall acknowledged his
greatest indebtedness, and who was universally acknowledged to be the
leader of the American Bar from 1810 until his death twelve years later. Besides being a great lawyer, Pinkney was also a notable personality, as
George Ticknor's sketch of him as he appeared before the Supreme Court
in 1815 goes to prove:

You must imagine, if you can, a man formed on nature's most liberal
scale, who at the age of 50 is possessed with the ambition of being a
pretty fellow, wears corsets to diminish his bulk, uses cosmetics, as he
told Mrs. Gore, to smooth and soften a skin growing somewhat wrinkled
and rigid with age, dresses in a style which would be thought foppish in
a much younger man. You must imagine such a man standing before the
gravest tribunal in the land, and engaged in causes of the deepest
moment; but still apparently thinking
4409 Green Overpass Suite 129
Nicholasshire, TN 75970
 how he can declaim like a
practised rhetorician in the London Cockpit, which he used to frequent. Yet you must, at the same time, imagine his declamation to be chaste and
precise in its language and cogent, logical and learned in its argument,
free from the artifice and affectation of his manner, and in short,
opposite to what you might fairly have expected from his first
appearance and tones. And when you have compounded these inconsistencies
in your imagination, and united qualities which on common occasions
nature seems to hold asunder, you will, perhaps, begin to form some idea
of what Mr. Pinkney is. Such was the man whom Marshall, Story, and Taney all considered the
greatest lawyer who had ever appeared before the Supreme Court. At the close of the War of 1812, Marshall, though he had decided many
important questions of International Law, ¹ nevertheless found himself
only at the threshold of his real fame. Yet even thus early he had
indicated his point of view. Thus in the case of the United States vs.
Peters, ² which was decided in 1809, the question before the Court was
whether a mandamus should issue to the United States District Judge of
Pennsylvania ordering him to enforce, in the face of the opposition of
the state Government, a decision handed down in a prize case more than
thirty years before by the old Committee of Appeals of the
837 Lee Union
New Charleschester, OH 36114
 Continental
Congress."|('4409 Green Overpass Suite 129\nNicholasshire, TN 75970', '837 Lee Union\nNew Charleschester, OH 36114')
"Marshall answered the question affirmatively,
7125 Lisa Extension Suite 915
New Nichole, WY 37277
 saying: ""If the
legislatures of the several states may, at will, annul the judgments of
the courts of the United States and destroy the rights acquired under
those judgments, the Constitution itself becomes a solemn mockery, and
the nation is deprived of the means of enforcing its laws by the
instrumentality of its own tribunals."" ¹ Two famous decisions of Marshall's in this field are those in the
Schooner Exchange vs. McFaddon et al, 7 Cranch, 116, and the case of the
Nereide, 9 ib., 388. ² 5 Cranch, 136. Marshall's decision evoked a warm protest from the Pennsylvania
Legislature and led to a proposal of amendment to the Constitution
providing ""an impartial tribunal"" between the General Government and the
States; and these expressions of dissent in turn brought the Virginia
Assembly to the defense of the Supreme Court. The commission to whom was referred the communication of the governor of
Pennsylvania [reads the Virginia document] ... are of the opinion that a
tribunal is already provided by the Constitution of the United States,
to wit; the Supreme Court, more eminently qualified from their habits
and duties, from the mode of their selection, and from the tenure of
their offices, to decide the disputes aforesaid in an enlightened and
impartial manner than any other tribunal which could be created. The members of the Supreme Court are selected from those in the United
States who are most celebrated for virtue and legal learning.... The
duties they have to perform lead them necessarily to the most enlarged
and accurate acquaintance with the jurisdiction of the federal and
several State courts together, and with the admirable symmetry of our
government. The tenure of their offices enables them to pronounce the
sound and correct opinions they have formed, without fear, favor or
partiality. Was it coincidence or something more that during Marshall's incumbency
Virginia paid her one and only tribute to the impartiality of the
Supreme Court while Burr's acquittal was still vivid in the minds of
all? Or was it due to the fact that ""the Great Lama of the Little
Mountain""--to use Marshall's disrespectful appellation for
Jefferson--had not yet converted the Virginia Court of Appeals into the
angry oracle of his own unrelenting hatred of the Chief

"Whatever the reason, within five years Virginia's attitude had again
shifted, and she had become once more what she had been in 1798-99, the
rallying point of the forces of Confederation and State Rights. CHAPTER V

The Tenets Of Nationalism

""John Marshall stands in history as one of that small group of men who
have founded States. He was a nation-maker, a state-builder. His
monument is in the history of the United States and his name is written
upon the Constitution of his country."" So spoke Senator Lodge, on John
Marshall Day, February 4, 1901. ""I should feel a ... doubt,"" declared
Justice Holmes on the same occasion, ""whether, after Hamilton and the
Constitution itself, Marshall's work proved more than a strong
intellect, a good style, personal ascendancy in his court, courage,
justice, and the convictions of his party."" Both these divergent
estimates of the great Chief Justice have their value. It is well to be
reminded that Marshall's task lay within the four corners of the
Constitution, whose purposes he did not originate, especially since no
one would have been quicker than himself to disown praise implying
anything different. None the less it was no ordinary skill and courage
which, assisted by great office, gave enduring definition to the
purposes of the Constitution at the very time when the whole trend of
public opinion was setting in most strongly against them. It must not be
forgotten that Hamilton, whose name Justice Holmes invokes in his
somewhat too grudging encomium of Marshall, had pronounced the
Constitution ""a frail and worthless
027 King Mountains Apt. 207
Ronaldmouth, NM 01207
 fabric."""|('027 King Mountains Apt. 207\nRonaldmouth, NM 01207',)
"Marshall's own outlook upon his task sprang in great part from a
profound conviction of calling. He was thoroughly persuaded that he knew
the intentions of the framers of the Constitution--the intentions which
had been wrought into the instrument itself--and he was equally
determined that these intentions should prevail. For this reason he
refused to regard his office merely as a judicial tribunal; it was a
platform from which to promulgate sound constitutional principles, the
very cathedra indeed of constitutional orthodoxy. Not one of the cases
which elicited his great opinions
956 Michael Orchard
Lisamouth, WV 70305
 but might easily have been decided on
comparatively narrow grounds in precisely the same way in which he
decided it on broad, general principles, but with the probable result
that it would never again have been heard of outside the law courts. To
take a timid or obscure way to a merely tentative goal would have been
at variance equally with Marshall's belief in his mission and with his
instincts as a great debater. Hence he forged his weapon--the obiter
dictum--by whose broad strokes was hewn the highroad of a national
destiny. Marshall's task naturally was not performed in vacuo: he owed much to
the preconceptions of his contemporaries. His invariable quest, as
students of his opinions are soon aware, was for the axiomatic, for
absolute principles, and in this inquiry he met the intellectual demands
of a period whose first minds still owned the sway of the syllogism and
still loved what Bacon called the ""spacious liberty of generalities."" In
Marshall's method--as in the older syllogistic logic, whose phraseology
begins to sound somewhat strange to twentieth century ears--the
essential operation consisted in eliminating the ""accidental"" or
""irrelevant"" elements from the ""significant"" facts of a case, and then
recognizing that this particular case had been foreseen and provided for
in a general rule of law. Proceeding in this way Marshall was able to
build up a body of thought the internal consistency of which, even when
it did not convince, yet baffled the only sort of criticism which
contemporaries were disposed to

Port Jeffchester, KS 39880
 apply."|('956 Michael Orchard\nLisamouth, WV 70305', '77053 Hahn Knoll Apt. 083\nPort Jeffchester, KS 39880')
"Listen, for instance, to the
despairing cry of John Randolph of Roanoke: ""All wrong,"" said he of one
of Marshall's opinions, ""all wrong, but no man in the United States can
tell why or wherein."" Marshall found his first opportunity to elaborate the tenets of his
nationalistic creed in the case of M'Culloch vs. Maryland, which was
decided at the same term with the Dartmouth College case and that of
Sturges vs. Crowinshield--the greatest six weeks in the history of the
Court. The question immediately involved was whether the State of
Maryland had the right to tax the notes issued by the branch which the
Bank of the United States had recently established
336 Mark Neck Apt. 207
Raymondtown, RI 58062
 at Baltimore. But
this question raised the further one whether the United States had in
the first place the right to charter the Bank and to authorize it to
establish branches within the States. The outcome turned on the
interpretation to be given the ""necessary and proper"" clause of the
Constitution. The last two questions were in 1819 by no means novel. In the Federalist
itself Hamilton had boldly asked, ""Who is to judge of the necessity and
propriety of the laws to be passed for executing the powers of the
Union?"" and had announced that ""the National Government, like every
other, must judge in the first instance, of the proper exercise of its
powers, and its constituents in the last,"" a view which seems hardly to
leave room even for judicial control. Three years later as Secretary of
the Treasury, Hamilton had brought forward the proposal which soon led
to the chartering of the Bank of 1791. The measure precipitated the
first great discussion over the interpretation of the new
35760 Sandra Ville Suite 134
West Rita, AZ 15099
 Constitution."|('336 Mark Neck Apt. 207\nRaymondtown, RI 58062', '35760 Sandra Ville Suite 134\nWest Rita, AZ 15099')
"Hamilton owned that Congress had no specifically granted power to
charter a bank but contended that such an institution was a ""necessary
and proper"" means for carrying out certain of the enumerated powers of
the National Government such, for instance, as borrowing money and
issuing a currency. For, said
4791 Wood Islands Suite 583
Jacksonton, MA 63787
 he in effect, ""necessary and proper""
signify ""convenient,"" and the clause was intended to indicate that the
National Government should enjoy a wide range of choice in the selection
of means for carrying out its enumerated powers. Jefferson, on the other
hand, maintained that the ""necessary and proper"" clause was a
restrictive clause, meant to safeguard the rights of the States, that a
law in order to be ""necessary and proper"" must be both ""necessary"" and
""proper,"" and that both terms ought to be construed narrowly. Jefferson's opposition, however, proved unavailing, and the banking
institution which was created continued till 1811 without its validity
being once tested in the courts. The second Bank of the United States, whose branch Maryland was now
trying to tax, received its charter in 1816 from President Madison. Well
might John Quincy Adams exclaim that the ""Republicans had outfederalized
the Federalists!"" Yet the gibe was premature. The country at large was
as yet blind to the responsibilities of nationality. That vision of
national unity which indubitably underlies the Constitution was after
all the vision of an aristocracy conscious of a solidarity of interests
transcending state lines. It is equally true that until the Civil War,
at the earliest, the great mass of Americans still felt themselves to be
first of all citizens of their particular

 States."|('4791 Wood Islands Suite 583\nJacksonton, MA 63787', '8734 Brandon Way\nNorth Davidborough, IN 35555')
"Nor did this
individualistic bias long remain in want of leadership capable of giving
it articulate expression. The amount of political talent which existed
within the State of Virginia alone in the first generation of our
national history is amazing to contemplate, but this talent
unfortunately exhibited one most damaging blemish. The intense
individualism of the planter-aristocrat could not tolerate in any
possible situation the idea of a control which he could not himself
ultimately either direct or reject. In the Virginia and Kentucky
resolutions of 1798 and 1799, which regard the Constitution as a compact
of sovereign States and the National Government merely as their agent,
the particularistic outlook definitely received a constitutional creed
which in time was to become, at least in the South, a gloss upon the
Constitution regarded as fully as authoritative as the original
instrument.
32735 Johnston Brooks Apt. 766
Lake Richardchester, PA 35746
 This recognition of state sovereignty was, indeed, somewhat
delayed by the federalization of the Republican party in consequence of
the capture of the National Government by Virginia in 1800. But in 1819
the march toward dissolution and civil war which had begun at the
summons of Jefferson was now definitely resumed. This was the year of
the congressional struggle over the admission of Missouri, the most
important result of which was the discovery by the slave owners that the
greatest security of slavery lay in the powers of the States and that
its greatest danger lay in those of the National Government. Henceforth
the largest property interest of the country stood almost solidly behind
State Rights. It was at this critical moment that chance presented Marshall with the
opportunity to place the opposing doctrine of nationalism on the high
plane of judicial decision. The arguments in the Bank case, ¹ which
began on February 22, 1819, and lasted nine days, brought together a
""constellation of lawyers"" such as had never appeared before in a
4985 Willis Spring Suite 732
New Deborahmouth, SD 10556
 single
case."|('32735 Johnston Brooks Apt. 766\nLake Richardchester, PA 35746', '4985 Willis Spring Suite 732\nNew Deborahmouth, SD 10556')
"The Bank was represented
4043 Hector Causeway Suite 049
New Daniel, AL 46747
 by Pinkney, Webster, and Wirt; the State,
by Luther Martin, Hopkinson, and Walter Jones of the District of
Columbia bar. In arguing for the State, Hopkinson urged the restrictive
view of the ""necessary and proper"" clause and sought to reduce to an
absurdity the doctrine of ""implied rights."" The Bank, continued
Hopkinson, ""this creature of construction,"" claims by further
implication ""the right to enter the territory of a State without its
consent"" and to establish there a branch; then, by yet another
implication, the branch claims exemption from taxation. ""It is thus with
the famous fig-tree of India, whose branches shoot from the trunk to a
considerable distance, then drop to the earth, where they take root and
become trees from which also other branches shoot ..., until gradually a
vast surface is covered, and everything perishes in the spreading
shade."" But even granting that Congress did have the right to charter
the Bank, still that fact would not exempt the institution from taxation
by any State within which it held property. ""The exercise of the one
sovereign power cannot be controlled by the exercise of the other."" ¹ M'Culloch vs. Maryland (1819), 4 Wheaton, 316. On the other side, Pinkney made the chief argument in behalf of the
Bank. ""Mr. Pinkney,"" says Justice Story, ""rose on Monday to conclude the
argument; he spoke all that day and yesterday and will probably conclude
to-day. I never in my whole life heard a greater speech; it was worth a
journey from Salem to hear it; his elocution was excessively vehement;
but his eloquence was

"His language, his style, his
figures, his argument, were
8484 Kevin Neck Suite 855
Deniseview, ID 17588
 most brilliant and sparkling. He spoke like
a great statesman and patriot and a sound constitutional lawyer. All the
cobwebs of sophistryship and metaphysics about State Rights and State
Sovereignty he brushed away with a mighty besom."" Pinkney closed on the 3d of March, and on the 6th Marshall handed down
his most famous opinion. He condensed Pinkney's three-day argument into
a pamphlet which may be easily read by the instructed layman in half an
hour, for, as is invariably the case with Marshall, his condensation
made for greater clarity. In this opinion he also gives evidence, in
their highest form, of his other notable qualities as a judicial
stylist: his ""tiger instinct for the jugular vein""; his rigorous pursuit
of logical consequences; his power of stating a case, wherein he is
rivaled
8285 Calderon Mountains
Josephfurt, MT 17765
 only by Mansfield; his scorn of the qualifying ""but's,"" ""if's,""
and ""though's""; the pith and balance of his phrasing, a reminiscence of
his early days with Pope; the developing momentum of his argument; above
all, his audacious use of the obiter dictum. Marshall's later opinion in
Gibbons vs. Ogden is, it is true, in some respects a greater
intellectual performance, but it does not equal this earlier opinion in
those qualities of form which attract the amateur and stir the
admiration of posterity. At the very outset of his argument in the Bank case Marshall singled out
the question the answer to which must control all interpretation of the
Constitution: Was the Constitution, as contended by counsel for
Maryland, ""an act of sovereign and independent States"" whose political
interests must be jealously safeguarded in its construction, or, was it
an emanation from the American people and designed for their benefit? Marshall answered that the Constitution, by its own declaration, was
""ordained and established"" in the name of the people, ""in order to form
a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity,
and secure the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity."" Nor did he consider the argument ""that the people had already
surrendered all their powers to the State Sovereignties and had nothing
more to give,"" a persuasive one, for ""surely, the question whether they
may resume and modify the power granted to the government does not
remain to be settled in this country."|('8484 Kevin Neck Suite 855\nDeniseview, ID 17588', '8285 Calderon Mountains\nJosephfurt, MT 17765')
"Much more might the legitimacy of
the General Government be doubted, had it been created by the States. The powers delegated to the State sovereignties were to be exercised by
themselves, not by a distinct and independent sovereignty created by
them."" ""The Government of the Union, then,"" Marshall proceeded, ""is
emphatically ... a government of the people. In form and in substance it
emanates from them. Its powers are granted by them, and are to be
exercised on them, and for their benefit."" And what was the nature of
this Government? ""If any one proposition could command the universal
assent of mankind we might expect it would be this: that the government
of the Union, though limited in its powers, is supreme within the sphere
of its action. This would seem to result necessarily from its nature. It
is the government of all; its powers are delegated by all; it represents
all and acts for all."" However the question had not been left to
609 Joshua Glen Suite 218
Martinstad, UT 41414
 reason."|('609 Joshua Glen Suite 218\nMartinstad, UT 41414',)
"""The people have in express terms decided it by saying: 'This
Constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in
pursuance thereof ... shall be the supreme Law of the Land.'"" But a Government which is supreme must have the right to choose the
means by which to make its supremacy effective; and indeed, at this
point again the Constitution comes to the aid of reason by declaring
specifically that Congress may make all laws ""necessary and proper"" for
carrying into execution any of the powers of the General Government. Counsel for Maryland would read this clause as limiting the right which
it recognized to the choice only of such means of execution as are
indispensable; they would treat the word ""necessary"" as controlling the
clause and to this they would affix the word ""absolutely."" ""Such is the
character of human language,"" rejoins the Chief Justice, ""that no word
conveys to the mind in all situations, one single definite idea,"" and
the word ""necessary,"" ""like others, is used in various senses,"" so that
its context becomes most material in determining its significance. And what is its context on this occasion? ""The subject is the execution
of those great powers on which the welfare of a nation essentially
depends."" The provision occurs ""in a Constitution
511 Christian Rapids
Benjaminhaven, NH 56255
 intended to endure for
ages to come and consequently to be adapted to the various crises of
human affairs."" The purpose of the clause therefore is not to impair the
right of Congress ""to exercise its best judgment in the selection of
measures to carry into execution the constitutional powers of the
Government,"" but rather ""to remove all doubts respecting the right to
legislate on that vast mass of incidental powers which must be involved
in the Constitution, if that instrument be not a splendid bauble.... Let
the end be legitimate, let it be within the scope of the Constitution
and all means which are appropriate, which are plainly adapted to that
end, which are not prohibited but consist with the letter and spirit of
the Constitution, are constitutional."" But was the Act of Maryland which taxed the Bank in conflict with the
Act of Congress which established it? If so, must the State yield
843 Francisco Squares Suite 052

 to
Congress?"|('511 Christian Rapids\nBenjaminhaven, NH 56255', '843 Francisco Squares Suite 052\nWilliamsfort, MN 75150')
"In approaching this question Marshall again laid the basis for
as sweeping a decision as possible. The terms in which the Maryland
statute was couched indicated clearly that it was directed specifically
against the Bank, and it might easily have been set aside on that
ground. But Marshall went much further and laid down the principle that
the instrumentalities of the National Government are never subject to
taxation by the States in any form whatsoever, and for two reasons. In
the first place,
80463 Garcia Circles
Michaelshire, KY 44305
 ""those means are not given by the people of a
particular State ... but by the people of all the States. They are given
by all for the benefit of all,"" and owe their presence in the State not
to the State's permission but to a higher authority. The State of
Maryland therefore never had the power to tax the Bank in the first
place. Yet waiving this theory, there was, in the second place, flat
incompatibility between the Act of Maryland and the Act of Congress, not
simply because of the specific operation of the former, but rather
because of the implied claim which it made for state authority. ""That
the power to tax involves the power to destroy,"" Marshall continued;
""that the power to destroy may defeat and render useless the power to
create; that there is a plain repugnance in conferring on one government
a power to control the constitutional measures of another, which other,
with respect to those very measures is declared to be supreme over that
which exerts the control, are propositions not to be denied."" Nor indeed
is the sovereignty of the State confined to taxation. ""That is not the
only mode in which it might be

 displayed."|('80463 Garcia Circles\nMichaelshire, KY 44305', 'Unit 3691 Box 2549\nDPO AA 93910')
"The question is in truth, a
question of supremacy, and if the right of the States to tax the means
employed by the General Government be conceded, the declaration
8143 Miller Lake Suite 223
West Charles, KY 67886
 that the
Constitution and the laws made in pursuance thereof shall be supreme law
of the land, is empty and unmeaning declamation.... We are unanimously
of opinion,"" concluded the Chief Justice, ""that the law ... of Maryland,
imposing a tax on the Bank of the United States is unconstitutional and
void."" Five years later, in the case of Gibbons vs. Ogden, ¹ known to
contemporaries as the ""Steamboat case,"" Marshall received the
opportunity to apply his principles of constitutional construction to
the power of Congress to regulate ""commerce among the States."" For a
quarter of a century Robert R. Livingston and Robert Fulton and their
successors had enjoyed from the Legislature of New York a grant of the
exclusive right to run steamboats on the waters of the State, and in
this case one of their licensees, Ogden, was seeking to prevent Gibbons,
who had steamers in the coasting trade under an Act of Congress, from
operating them on the Hudson in trade between points in New York and New
Jersey. A circumstance which made the case the more critical was that
New Jersey and Connecticut had each passed retaliatory statutes
excluding from
16600 Heather Ways Apt. 515
Paigeton, AK 31534
 their waters any vessel licensed under the
Fulton-Livingston monopoly. The condition of interstate commercial
warfare which thus threatened was not unlike that which had originally
operated so potently to bring about the Constitution. ¹ 9 Wheaton, 1. The case of Gibbons vs. Ogden was argued in the early days of February,
1824, with Attorney-General Wirt and Daniel Webster against the grant,
while two famous New York lawyers of the day, Thomas Addis Emmet,
brother of the Irish patriot, and Thomas J. Oakley, acted as Ogden's
counsel. The arguments have the importance necessarily attaching to a
careful examination of a novel legal question of the first magnitude by
learned and acute minds, but some of the claims that have been made for
these arguments, and especially for Webster's effort, hardly sustain
investigation. Webster, never in any case apt to regard his own
performance overcritically, seems in later years to have been persuaded
that the Chief Justice's opinion ""followed closely the track"" of his
argument on this occasion; and it is true that Marshall expressed
sympathy with Webster's contention that Congress may regulate as truly
by inaction as by action, since inaction may indicate its wish that the
matter go unregulated; but the Chief Justice did not explicitly adopt
this idea, and the major part of his opinion was a running refutation of
Emmet's argument, which in turn was only an elaboration of Chancellor
Kent's opinion upon the same subject in the New York courts. ¹ In other
words, this was one of those cases in which Marshall's indebtedness to
counsel was far less for ideas than for the stimulation which his own
powers always received from discussion; and the result is his
profoundest, most statesmanlike opinion, from whose doctrines the Court
has at times deviated, but only to return to them, until today it is
more nearly than ever before the established law on the many points
covered by its

 dicta."|('8143 Miller Lake Suite 223\nWest Charles, KY 67886', '16600 Heather Ways Apt. 515\nPaigeton, AK 31534', '13293 Martin Plains Suite 684\nJackton, VA 52748')
"¹ See Livingston vs. Van Ingen, 9 Johnson, 807 (1812); also Kent's
Commentaries, I, 432-38. Marshall pronounced the Fulton-Livingston monopoly inoperative so far as
it concerned vessels enrolled under the Act of Congress to engage in the
coasting trade; but in arriving at this very simple result his opinion
takes the broadest possible range. At the
5457 Anderson Square
Odonnellhaven, SC 28130
 very outset Marshall flatly
contradicts Kent's proposition that the powers of the General
Government, as representing a grant by sovereignties, must be strictly
construed. The Constitution, says he, ""contains an enumeration of powers
expressly granted by the people to their government,"" and there is not a
word in it which lends any countenance to the idea that these powers
should be strictly interpreted. As men whose intentions required no
concealment, those who framed and adopted the Constitution ""must be
understood to have employed words in their natural sense and to have
intended what they said""; but if, from the inherent imperfection of
language, doubts were at any time to arise ""respecting the extent of any
given power,"" then the known purposes of the instrument should control
the construction put on its phraseology. ""The grant does not convey
power which might be beneficial to the grantor if retained by himself
... but is an investment of power for the general advantage in the hands
of agents selected for the purpose, which power can never be exercised
by the people themselves, but must be placed in the hands of agents or
remain dormant."" In no other of his opinions did Marshall so clearly
bring out the logical connection between the principle of liberal
construction of the Constitution and the doctrine that it is an
ordinance of the American people. Turning then to the Constitution, Marshall asks, ""What is commerce?"" ""Counsel for appellee,"" he recites, ""would limit it to traffic, to
buying and selling,"" to which he answers that ""this would restrict a
general term ... to one of its significations. Commerce,"" he continues,
""undoubtedly is traffic, but it is something more--it is intercourse,""
and so includes

 navigation."|('5457 Anderson Square\nOdonnellhaven, SC 28130', '77368 Lewis Rue\nEast Oscarview, DE 02762')
"And what is the power of Congress over
commerce? ""It is the power to regulate, that is, the power to prescribe
the rule by which commerce is to be governed."" It is a power ""complete
in itself,""
29021 Jesse Ports Suite 648
South Jeffrey, AR 50765
 exercisable ""at its utmost extent,"" and without limitations
""other than are prescribed by the Constitution.... If, as has always
been understood, the sovereignty of Congress, though limited to
specified objects, is plenary as to those objects, the power over
commerce with foreign nations and among the several States is vested in
Congress as absolutely as it would be in a single government having in
its constitution the same restrictions on the exercise of power as are
found in the Constitution of the United States."" The power, therefore,
is not to be confined by state lines but acts upon its subject-matter
wherever it is to be found. ""It may, of consequence,
5224 Reid Station
Port Vanessatown, WY 08404
 pass the
jurisdictional line of New York and act upon the very waters to which
the prohibition now under consideration applies."" It is a power to be
exercised within the States and not merely at their frontiers. But was it sufficient for Marshall merely to define the power of
Congress? Must not the power of the State also be considered? At least,
Ogden's attorneys had argued, the mere existence in Congress of the
power to regulate commerce among the States did not prevent New York
from exercising the same power, through legislation operating upon
subject matter within its own
46763 Harrison Parks Apt. 533

 boundaries."|('29021 Jesse Ports Suite 648\nSouth Jeffrey, AR 50765', '5224 Reid Station\nPort Vanessatown, WY 08404', '46763 Harrison Parks Apt. 533\nTranborough, NY 19145')
"No doubt, he concedes, the
States have the right to enact many kinds of laws which will
incidentally affect commerce among the States, such for instance as
quarantine and health laws, laws regulating bridges and ferries, and so
on; but this they do by virtue of their power of ""internal police,"" not
by virtue of a ""concurrent"" power over commerce, foreign and interstate. And, indeed, New York may have granted Fulton and Livingston their
monopoly in exercise of this power, in which case its validity would
depend upon its not conflicting with an Act of Congress regulating
commerce. For should
03388 Gloria Course
Port Ryanburgh, AR 83311
 such conflict exist, the State enactment, though
passed ""in the exercise of its acknowledged sovereignty,"" must give
place in consequence of the supremacy conferred by the Constitution upon
all acts of Congress in pursuance of it, over all state laws whatsoever. The opinion then proceeds to the consideration of the Act of Congress
relied upon by Gibbons. This, Ogden's attorneys contended, merely
conferred the American character upon vessels already possessed of the
right to engage in the coasting trade; Marshall, on the contrary, held
that it conferred the right itself, together with the auxiliary right of
navigating the waters of the United States; whence it followed that New
York was powerless to exclude Gibbons's vessels from the Hudson. Incidentally Marshall indicated his opinion that Congress's power
extended to the carriage of passengers as well as of goods and to
vessels propelled by steam as well as to those driven by wind. ""The one
element,"" said he, ""may be as legitimately used as the other for every
commercial purpose authorized by the laws of the Union."" Two years later, in the case of Brown vs. Maryland, ¹ Marshall laid down
his famous doctrine that so long as goods introduced into a State in the
course of foreign trade remain in the hands of the importer and in the
original package, they are not subject to taxation by the State. This
doctrine is interesting for two reasons. In the first place, it implies
the further principle that an attempt by a State to tax interstate or
foreign commerce is tantamount to an attempt to regulate such commerce,
and is consequently v
1007 Castro Radial
East Hannahport, FL 92839
oid."|('03388 Gloria Course\nPort Ryanburgh, AR 83311', '1007 Castro Radial\nEast Hannahport, FL 92839')
"In other words, the principle of the
exclusiveness of Congress's power to regulate commerce among the States
and with foreign nations, which is advanced by way of dictum in Gibbons
vs. Ogden, becomes in Brown vs. Maryland a ground of decision. It is a
principle which has proved of the utmost importance in keeping the field
of national power clear of encumbering state legislation against the day
when Congress should elect to step in and assume effective control. Nor
can there be much doubt
9723 Jennifer Lights
Port Matthew, NE 12763
 that the result was intended by the framers of
the Constitution. ¹ 12 Wheaton, 419. In the second place, however, from another point of view this ""original
package doctrine"" is only an extension of the immunity from state
taxation established in M'Culloch vs. Maryland for instrumentalities of
the National Government. It thus reflects the principle implied by that
decision: where power exists to any degree or for any purpose, it exists
to every degree and for every purpose; or, to quote Marshall's own words
in Brown vs. Maryland, ""questions of power do not depend upon the degree
to which it may be exercised; if it may be exercised at all, it may be
exercised at the will of those in whose hands it is placed."" The
attitude of the Court nowadays, when it has to deal with state
legislation, is very different. It takes the position that abuse of
power, in relation to private rights or to commerce, is excess of power
and hence demands to be shown the substantial effect of legislation, not
its mere formal justification. ¹ In short, its inquiry is into facts. On
the other hand, when dealing with congressional legislation, the Court
has hitherto always followed Marshall's bolder method."|('9723 Jennifer Lights\nPort Matthew, NE 12763',)
"Thus Congress may
use its taxing power to drive out unwholesome businesses, perhaps even
to regulate labor within the States, and it may close the channels of
interstate and foreign commerce to articles deemed by it injurious to
the public health or morals. ² To date this discrepancy between the
methods employed by the Court in passing upon the validity of
legislation within the two fields of state and national power has
afforded the latter a decided advantage. ¹ See Justice Bradley's language in 122 U. S., 326; also the more recent
case of Western Union Telegraph Company vs. Kan., 216 U. S., 1. ² See 195 U. S., 27; 188 U. S., 321; 227 U. S., 308. 247 U. S., 251. The great principles which Marshall developed in his interpretation of
the Constitution from the side of national power and which after various
ups and downs may be reckoned as part of the law of the land today, were
the following:

1. The Constitution is an ordinance of the people of the United States,
and not a compact of States. Consequently it is to be interpreted with a view to securing a
beneficial use of the powers which it creates, not with the purpose of
safeguarding the prerogatives of state sovereignty. The Constitution was further designed, as near as may be, ""for
immortality,"" and hence was to be ""adapted to the various crises of
human affairs,"" to be kept a commodious vehicle of the national life and
not made the Procrustean bed of the nation. While the government which the Constitution established is one of
enumerated powers, as to those powers it is a sovereign government, both
in its choice of the means by which to exercise its powers and in its
supremacy over all colliding or antagonistic
69404 Thompson Branch Apt. 609
Melissaside, MI 27244
 powers."|('69404 Thompson Branch Apt. 609\nMelissaside, MI 27244',)
"The power of Congress to regulate commerce is an exclusive power, so
that the States may not intrude upon this field even though Congress has
not acted.
USNS Petty
FPO AP 79795
 The National Government and its instrumentalities are present within
the States, not by the tolerance of the States, but by the supreme
authority of the people of the United States. ¹

¹ For the application of Marshall's canons of constitutional
interpretation in the field of treaty making, see the writer's National
Supremacy (N. Y., 1913). Of these several principles, the first is obviously the most important
and to a great extent the source of the others. It is the principle of
which Marshall, in face of the rising tide of State Rights, felt himself
to be in a peculiar sense the official custodian. It is the principle
which he had in mind in his noble plea at the close of the case of
Gibbons vs. Ogden for a construction of the Constitution capable of
maintaining its vitality and usefulness:

Powerful and ingenious minds [run his words], taking as postulates that
the powers expressly granted to the Government of the Union are to be
contracted by construction into the narrowest possible compass and that
the original powers of the States are to be retained if any possible
construction will retain them, may by a course of refined and
metaphysical reasoning ... explain away the Constitution of our country
and leave it a magnificent structure indeed to look at, but totally
unfit for use. They may so entangle and perplex the understanding as to
obscure principles which were before thought quite plain, and induce
doubts where, if the mind were to pursue its own course, none would be
perceived. In such a case, it is peculiarly necessary to recur to safe
and fundamental principles. CHAPTER VI

The Sanctity Of Contracts

Marshall's work was one of conservation in so far as it was concerned
with interpreting the Constitution in accord with the intention which
its framers had of establishing an efficient National Government. But he
found a task of restoration awaiting him in that great field of
Constitutional Law which defines state powers in relation to
29338 Andrew Drive
South Wayne, NM 66698
 private
rights."|('USNS Petty\nFPO AP 79795', '29338 Andrew Drive\nSouth Wayne, NM 66698')
"To provide adequate safeguards for property and contracts against state
legislative power was one of the most important objects of the framers,
if indeed it was not the most important. Consider, for instance, a
colloquy which occurred early in the Convention between Madison and
Sherman of Connecticut. The latter had enumerated ""the objects of Union""
as follows: ""First, defense against foreign danger; secondly, against
internal disputes and a resort
9209 Johnston Crescent Suite 241
Jeremytown, WV 82494
 to force; thirdly, treaties with foreign
nations; fourthly, regulating foreign commerce and drawing revenue from
it."" To this statement Madison demurred. The objects mentioned were
important, he admitted, but he ""combined with them the necessity of
providing more effectually for the securing of private rights and the
steady dispensation of justice. Interferences with these were evils
which had, more perhaps than anything else, produced this Convention."" Marshall's sympathy with this point of view we have already noted. ¹ Nor
was Madison's reference solely to the then recent activity of state
Legislatures in behalf of the much embarrassed but politically dominant
small farmer class. He had also in mind that other and more ancient
practice of Legislatures of enacting so-called ""special legislation,""
that is, legislation altering under the standing law the rights of
designated parties, and not infrequently to their serious detriment. Usually such legislation took the form of an intervention by the
Legislature in private controversies pending in, or already decided by,
the ordinary courts, with the result that judgments were set aside,
executions canceled, new hearings granted, new rules of evidence
introduced, void wills validated, valid contracts voided, forfeitures
pronounced--all by legislative

APO AE 56079
 mandate."|('9209 Johnston Crescent Suite 241\nJeremytown, WV 82494', 'PSC 3701, Box 6410\nAPO AE 56079')
"Since that day the courts have
developed an interpretation of the principle of the separation of powers
and have enunciated a theory of ""due process of law,"" which renders this
sort of legislative abuse quite impossible; but in 1787, though the
principle of the separation of powers had received verbal recognition in
several of the state Constitutions, no one as yet knew precisely what
the term ""legislative power"" signified, and at that time judicial review
did not exist. ² Hence those who wished to see this nuisance of special
legislation
78313 Kristina Squares Apt. 377
Ginaburgh, NM 18098
 abated felt not unnaturally that the relief must come from
some source external to the local governments, and they welcomed the
movement for a new national Constitution as affording them their
opportunity. ¹ See supra, p. 34 ff. ² On special legislation, see the writer's Doctrine of Judicial Review
(Princeton, 1914), pp. The Constitution, in Article I, Section X, forbids the States to ""emit
bills of credit, make anything but gold and silver a legal tender in
payment of debts, pass any bill of attainder, ex post facto law, or law
impairing the obligation of contracts."" Until 1798, the provision
generally regarded as offering the most promising weapon against special
legislation was the ex post facto clause. In that year, however, in its
decision in Calder vs. Bull the Court held that this clause ""was not
inserted to secure the citizen in his private rights of either property
or contracts,"" but only against certain kinds of penal legislation. The
decision roused sharp criticism and the judges themselves seemed fairly
to repent of it even in handing it down. Justice Chase, indeed, even
went so far as to suggest, as a sort of stop-gap to the breach they were
thus creating in the Constitution, the idea that, even in the absence of
written constitutional restrictions, the Social Compact as well as ""the
principles of our free republican governments"" afforded judicially
enforcible limitations upon legislative power in favor of private
rights. Then, in the years immediately following, several state courts,
building upon this dictum, had definitely announced their intention of
treating as void all legislation which they found unduly to disturb
vested rights, especially if it was confined in its operation to
specified
0585 Le View Suite 355
Stephaniemouth, KS 40710
 parties."|('78313 Kristina Squares Apt. 377\nGinaburgh, NM 18098', '0585 Le View Suite 355\nStephaniemouth, KS 40710')
"¹

¹ In connection with this paragraph, see the writer's article entitled
The Basic Doctrine of American Constitutional Law, in the Michigan Law
Review, February, 1914. Marshall once wrote Story regarding his attitude
toward Section X in 1787, as follows: ""The questions which were
perpetually recurring in the State legislatures and which brought
annually into doubt principles which I thought most sacred, which proved
that everything was afloat, and that we had no safe anchorage ground,
gave a high value in my estimation to that article of the Constitution
which imposes restrictions on the States."" Such was still the situation when the case of Fletcher vs. Peck ¹ in
1810 raised before the Supreme Court the question whether the Georgia
Legislature had the right to rescind a land grant made by a preceding
Legislature. On any of three grounds Marshall might easily have disposed
of this case before coming to the principal question. In the first
place, it was palpably a moot case; that is to say, it was to the
interest of the opposing parties to have the rescinding act set aside. The Court would not today take jurisdiction of such a case, but Marshall
does not even suggest such a solution of the question, though Justice
Johnson does in his concurring opinion. In the second place, Georgia's
own claim to the lands had been most questionable, and consequently her
right to grant them to others was equally dubious; but this, too, is an
issue which Marshall avoids. Finally, the grant had been procured by
corrupt means, but Marshall ruled that this was not a subject the Court
might enter upon; and for the ordinary run of cases in which undue
influence is alleged to have induced the enactment of a law, the ruling
is clearly sound. But this was no ordinary case. The fraud asserted
against the grant was a matter of universal notoriety; it was, indeed,
the most resounding scandal of the generation; and surely judges may
assume to know what is known to all and may act upon their
826 Peterson Branch Apt. 397
Jenniferland, AZ 90663
 knowledge."|('826 Peterson Branch Apt. 397\nJenniferland, AZ 90663',)
"¹ 6 Cranch, 87. Furthermore, when one turns to the part of Marshall's opinion which
deals with the constitutional issue, one finds not a little evidence of
personal predilection on the part of the
17653 Williams Ports Apt. 892
South Nicolas, HI 16032
 Chief Justice. He starts out by
declaring the rescinding act void as a violation of vested rights, of
the underlying principles of society and government, and of the doctrine
of the separation of powers. Then he apparently realizes that a decision
based on such grounds must be far less secure and much less generally
available than one based on the words of the Constitution; whereupon he
brings forward the obligation of contracts clause. At once, however, he
is confronted with the difficulty that the obligation of a contract is
the obligation of a contract still to be fulfilled, and that a grant is
an executed contract over and done with--functus officio. This
difficulty he meets by asserting that every grant is attended by an
implied contract on the part of the grantor not to reassert his right to
the thing granted. This, of course, is a palpable fiction on Marshall's
part, though certainly not an unreasonable one. For undoubtedly when a
grant is made without stipulation to the contrary, both parties assume
that it will be permanent. The greater difficulty arose from the fact that, whether implied or
explicit, the contract before the Court was a public one. In the case of
private contracts it is easy enough to distinguish the contract, as the
agreement between the parties, from the obligation of the contract which
comes from the law and holds the parties to their
325 Alexander Hollow Suite 287
West Johnland, MD 27318
 engagements."|('17653 Williams Ports Apt. 892\nSouth Nicolas, HI 16032', '325 Alexander Hollow Suite 287\nWest Johnland, MD 27318')
"But what
law was there to hold Georgia to her supposed agreement not to rescind
the grant she had made? Not the Constitution of the United States
unattended by any other law, since it protects the obligation only after
it has come into existence. Not the Constitution of Georgia as construed
by her own courts, since they had sustained the rescinding act. Only one
possibility remained; the State Constitution must be the source of the
obligation--yes; but the State Constitution as it was construed by the
United States Supreme Court in this very case, in the light of the
""general principles of our political institutions."" In short the
obligation is a moral one; and this moral obligation is treated by
Marshall as having been converted into a legal one by the United States
Constitution. However, Marshall apparently
9048 Crystal Drive Suite 990
Lake Brandi, SC 46714
 fails to find entire satisfaction in this
argument, for he next turns to the prohibition against bills of
attainder and ex post facto laws with a question which manifests
disapproval of the decision in Calder vs. Bull. Yet he hesitates to
overrule Calder vs. Bull, and, indeed, even at the very end of his
opinion he still declines to indicate clearly the basis of his decision. The State of Georgia, he says, ""was restrained"" from the passing of the
rescinding act ""either by general principles which are common to our
free institutions, or by particular provisions of the Constitution of
the United States."" It was not until nine years after Fletcher vs. Peck
that this ambiguity was cleared up in the Dartmouth College case in
1819. The case of the Trustees of Dartmouth College vs. Woodward ¹ was a New
England product and redolent of the soil from which it
340 Beck Divide
Bridgesville, OK 50312
 sprang."|('9048 Crystal Drive Suite 990\nLake Brandi, SC 46714', '340 Beck Divide\nBridgesville, OK 50312')
"In 1754
the Reverend Eleazar Wheelock of Connecticut had established at his own
expense a charity school for instructing Indians in the Christian
religion; and so great was his success that he felt encouraged to extend
the undertaking and to solicit donations in England. Again success
rewarded his efforts; and in 1769 Governor Wentworth of New Hampshire,
George III's representative granted the new institution, which was now
located at Hanover, New Hampshire, a charter incorporating twelve named
persons as ""The Trustees of Dartmouth College"" with the power to govern
the institution, appoint its officers, and fill all vacancies in their
own body ""forever."" ¹ The following account of this case is based on J. M. Shirley's
Dartmouth College Causes (St. Louis, 1879) and on the official report, 4
Wheaton, 518. For many years after the Revolution, the Trustees of Dartmouth College,
several of whom were ministers,
57458 Emily Spring
New Travis, AK 20293
 reflected the spirit of
Congregationalism. Though this form of worship occupied almost the
position of a state religion in New Hampshire, early in this period
difficulties arose in the midst of the church at Hanover. A certain
Samuel Hayes, or Haze, told a woman named Rachel Murch that her
character was ""as black as Hell,"" and upon Rachel's complaint to the
session, he was ""churched"" for ""breach of the Ninth Commandment and also
for a violation of his covenant agreement."" This incident caused a rift
which gradually developed into something very like a schism in the local
congregation, and this internal disagreement finally produced a split
between Eleazar's son, Dr. John Wheelock, who was now president of
Dartmouth College, and the Trustees of the institution. The result was
that in August, 1815, the Trustees ousted Wheelock. The quarrel had thus far involved only Calvinists and Federalists, but
in 1816 a new element was brought in by the interference of the Governor
of New Hampshire, William Plumer, formerly a Federalist but now, since
1812, the leader of the Jeffersonian party in the State. In a message to
the Legislature dated June 6, 1816, Plumer drew the attention of that
body to Dartmouth

"""All literary establishments,"" said he, ""like
everything human, if not duly attended to, are subject to decay.... As
it [the charter of the College] emanated from royalty, it contained, as
was natural it should, principles congenial to monarchy,"" and he cited
particularly the power of the Board of Trustees to perpetuate itself. ""This last principle,""
1569 Cabrera Road Suite 367
Deborahshire, OK 68793
 he continued, ""is hostile to the spirit and
genius of a free government. Sound policy therefore requires that the
mode of election should be changed and that Trustees in future should be
elected by some other body of men.... The College was formed for the
public good, not for the benefit or emolument of its Trustees; and the
right to amend and improve acts of incorporation of this nature has been
exercised by all governments, both monarchical and republican."" Plumer sent a copy of his message to Jefferson and received a
characteristic answer in reply: ""It is replete,"" said the Republican
sage, ""with sound principles.... The idea that institutions established
for the use of the nation cannot be touched nor modified, even to make
them answer their end ... is most absurd.... Yet our lawyers and priests
generally inculcate this doctrine, and suppose that preceding
generations held the earth more freely than we do; had a right to impose
laws on us, unalterable by ourselves; ... in fine, that
4344 Randall Row Suite 514
Kiddburgh, MD 63326
 the earth
belongs to the dead and not to the living."" And so, too, apparently the
majority of the Legislature believed; for by the measure which it
promptly passed, in response to Plumer's message, the College was made
Dartmouth University, the number of its trustees was increased to
twenty-one, the appointment of the additional members being given to the
Governor, and a board of overseers, also largely of gubernatorial
appointment, was created to supervise all important acts of the
trustees. The friends of the College at once denounced the measure as void under
both the State and the United States Constitution and soon made up a
test case. In order to obtain the college seal, charter, and records, a
mandate was issued early in 1817 by a local court to attach goods, to
the value of $50,000, belonging to William H. Woodward, the Secretary
and Treasurer of the
PSC 3849, Box 1472
APO AE 23072
 ""University."""|('1569 Cabrera Road Suite 367\nDeborahshire, OK 68793', '4344 Randall Row Suite 514\nKiddburgh, MD 63326', 'PSC 3849, Box 1472\nAPO AE 23072')
"This was served by attaching a chair
""valued at one dollar."" The story is also related that authorities of
the College, apprehending an argument that the institution had already
forfeited its charter on account of having ceased to minister to
Indians, sent across into Canada for some of the aborigines, and that
three were brought down the river to receive matriculation,
915 Phillips Branch Suite 796
Johnsonstad, VT 61557
 but becoming
panic-stricken as they neared the town, leaped into the water, swam
ashore, and disappeared in the forest. Unfortunately this interesting
tale has been seriously questioned. The attorneys of the College before the Superior Court were Jeremiah
Mason, one of the best lawyers of the day, Jeremiah Smith, a former
Chief Justice of New Hampshire, and Daniel Webster. These three able
lawyers argued that the amending act exceeded ""the rightful ends of
legislative power,"" violated the principle of the separation of powers,
and deprived the trustees of their ""privileges and immunities"" contrary
to the ""law of the land"" clause of the State Constitution, and impaired
the obligation of contracts. The last contention stirred Woodward's
attorneys, Bartlett and Sullivan, to ridicule. ""By the same reasoning,""
said the latter, ""every law must be considered in the nature of a
contract, until
61077 Holmes View
Onealhaven, WI 85513
 the Legislature would find themselves in such a
labyrinth of contracts, with the United States Constitution over their
heads, that not a subject would be left within their jurisdiction""; the
argument was an expedient of desperation, he said, a ""last straw."" The
principal contention advanced in behalf of the Act was that the College
was ""a public corporation,"" whose ""various powers, capacities, and
franchises all ... were to be exercised for the benefit of the public,""
and were therefore subject to public control. And the Court, in
sustaining the Act, rested its decision on the same ground. Chief
Justice Richardson conceded the doctrine of Fletcher vs. Peck, that the
obligation of contracts clause ""embraced all contracts relating to
private property, whether executed or executory, and whether between
individuals, between States, or between States and individuals,"" but, he
urged, ""a distinction is to be taken between particular grants by the
Legislature of property or privileges to individuals for their own
benefit, and grants of power and authority to be exercised for

 Of the later proceedings, involving the appeal to Washington and the
argument before Marshall, early in March, 1818, tradition has made
Webster the central and compelling figure, and to the words which it
assigns him in closing his address before the Court has largely been
attributed the great legal triumph which presently followed. The story
is, at least, so well found that the chronicler of Dartmouth College vs.
Woodward who should venture to omit it must be a bold man indeed. The argument ended [runs the tale], Mr. Webster stood for some moments
silent before the Court, while every eye was fixed intently upon him. At
length, addressing the Chief Justice, he proceeded thus: ""This, sir, is
my case. It is the case ... of every college in our land.... Sir, you
may destroy this little institution.... You may put it out. But if you
do so, you must carry through your work! You must extinguish, one after
another, all those greater lights of science, which, for more than a
century have thrown their radiance over our land. It is, Sir, as I have
said, a small college. And yet there are those who love it--""

Here, the feelings which he had thus far succeeded in keeping down,
broke forth, his lips quivered; his firm cheeks trembled with emotion,
his eyes filled with
6697 Scott Prairie
Catherinechester, WI 77750
 tears...."|('USCGC Herrera\nFPO AA 46886', '6697 Scott Prairie\nCatherinechester, WI 77750')
"The court-room during these two or three
minutes presented an extraordinary spectacle. Chief Justice Marshall,
with his tall and gaunt figure bent over, as if to catch the slightest
whisper, the deep furrows of his cheek expanded with emotion, and his
eyes suffused with tears; Mr. Justice Washington at his side, with small
and emaciated frame, and countenance more like marble than I ever saw on
any other human being.... There was not one among the strong-minded men
of that assembly who could think it unmanly to weep, when he saw
standing before him the man who had made such an argument, melted into
the tenderness of a child. Mr. Webster had now recovered his composure, and, fixing his keen eyes
on Chief Justice Marshall, said in that
805 Bright Ville Suite 869
West Melissa, FL 54276
 deep tone with which he
sometimes thrilled the heart of an audience: ""Sir, I know not how others
may feel ... but for myself, when I see my Alma Mater surrounded, like
Cæsar in the Senate house, by those who are reiterating stab after stab,
I would not, for my right hand, have her turn to me and say, Et tu
quoque mi fili! And thou, too, my son!"" Whether this extraordinary scene, first described thirty-four years
afterward by a putative witness of it, ever really occurred or not, it
is today impossible to say. ¹ But at least it would be an error to
attribute to it great importance. From the same source we have it that
at Exeter, too, Webster had made the judges weep--yet they had gone out
and decided against him. Judges do not always decide the way they weep! ¹ Professor Goodrich of Yale, who is responsible for the story,
communicated it to Rufus Choate in 1853."|('805 Bright Ville Suite 869\nWest Melissa, FL 54276',)
"It next appears on Goodrich's
authority in Curtis's Webster, vol. Of the strictly legal part of his argument Webster

 himself has left us a
synopsis. Fully three-quarters of it dealt with the questions which had
been discussed by Mason before the State Supreme Court under the New
Hampshire Constitution and was largely irrelevant to the great point at
issue at Washington. Joseph Hopkinson, who was now associated with
Webster, contributed far more to the content of Marshall's opinion; yet
he, too, left one important question entirely to the Chief Justice's
ingenuity, as will be indicated shortly. Fortunately for the College its
opponents were ill prepared to take advantage of the vulnerable points
of its defense. For some unknown reason, Bartlett and Sullivan, who had
carried the day at Exeter, had now given place to William Wirt and John
Holmes. Of these the former had just been made Attorney-General

that ""he had hardly thought of it till it was called on."" As for Holmes,

contemporaries as ""the noisy eulogist and reputed protégé of Jefferson."" A remarkable strategy that, which stood such a person up before John

"The next
morning the Chief Justice announced that the Court had conferred, that
there were different opinions, that some of the judges had not arrived
at a conclusion, and that consequently the cause must be continued. Webster, however, who was apt to be much in ""the know"" of such matters,
ventured to place the different judges thus: ""The Chief and Washington,""
he wrote his former colleague Smith, ""I have no doubt, are with us. Duvall and Todd
751 Ortiz Fields
Lynchtown, NE 09080
 perhaps against us; the other three holding up--I cannot
much doubt but that Story will be with us in the end, and I think we
have much more than an even chance for one of the others."" The friends of the College set promptly to work to bring over the
wavering judges. To their dismay they learned that Chancellor James Kent
of New York, whose views were known to have great weight with Justices
Johnson and Livingston, had expressed himself as convinced by Chief
Justice Richardson's opinion that Dartmouth College was a public
corporation. Fortunately, however, a little ransacking of the records
brought to light an opinion which Kent and Livingston had both signed as
early as 1803, when they were members of the New York Council of
Revision, and which took the ground that a then pending measure in the

series of conferences at Albany in which Chancellor Kent, Justice
Johnson, President Brown of Dartmouth College, Governor Clinton, and
others participated. As a result, the Chancellor owned himself converted

 who in vacation had accepted a retainer from the backers of
Woodward, that is, of the State, took his stand on the second day near
the Chief Justice, expecting to move for a reargument. Marshall,
""turning his blind eye"" to the distinguished Marylander, announced that
the Court had reached a decision, plucked from his sleeve an eighteen
folio manuscript opinion, and began reading it. He held that the College
was a ""private eleemosynary institution""; that its charter was the
outgrowth of a contract between the original donors and the Crown, that
the trustees represented the interest of the donors, and that the terms
of the Constitution were broad enough to cover and protect this
representative interest. The last was the only point on which he
confessed a real difficulty. The primary purpose of the constitutional
clause, he owned, was to protect ""contracts the parties to which have a
vested beneficial interest"" in them, whereas the trustees had no such
interest at stake. But, said he, the case is within the words of the
rule, and ""must be within its operation likewise, unless there be
something in the literal construction"" obviously at war with the spirit
of the Constitution, which was far from the fact. For, he continued, ""it
requires no very critical examination of the human mind to enable us to
determine that one great inducement to these gifts is the conviction
felt by the giver that the disposition he makes of them is immutable. All such gifts are made in the pleasing, perhaps delusive hope, that the
charity will flow forever in the channel which the givers have marked
out for it. If every man finds in his own bosom strong evidence of the
universality of this sentiment, there can be but little reason to
imagine that the framers of our Constitution were strangers to it, and
that, feeling the necessity and policy of giving permanence and security
to contracts"" generally, they yet deemed it desirable to leave this sort
of contract subject to legislative interference. Such is Marshall's
answer to Jefferson's outburst against ""the dead

 hand."""|('26838 Howard Village\nMaddenside, DE 55811', '053 Lewis Manors\nBanksstad, WI 59481')
"Characteristically, Marshall nowhere cites Fletcher vs. Peck in his
opinion, but he builds on the construction there made of the ""obligation
of contracts"" clause as clearly as do his associates, Story and
Washington, who cite it again and again in their concurring opinion. Thus he concedes that the British Parliament, in consequence of its
unlimited power, might at any time before the Revolution have annulled
the charter of the College and so have disappointed the hopes of the
donors; but, he adds, ""the perfidy of the transaction would have been
universally acknowledged."" Later on, he further admits that at the time
of the Revolution the people of New Hampshire succeeded to ""the
transcendent
74478 Steele Squares Suite 293
Maryview, NH 01049
 power of Parliament,"" as well as to that of the King, with
the result that a repeal of the charter before 1789 could have been
contested only under the State Constitution. ""But the Constitution of
the United States,"" he continues, ""has imposed this additional
limitation, that the Legislature of a State shall pass no act 'impairing
the obligation of contracts.'"" In short, as in Fletcher vs. Peck, what
was originally a moral obligation is regarded as having been lifted by
the Constitution into the full status of a legal one, and this time
without any assistance from ""the general principles of our free
institutions."" How is the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Dartmouth
College vs. Woodward to be assessed today? Logically the basis of it was
repudiated by the Court itself within a decade, albeit the rule it lays
down remained unaffected. Historically it is equally without basis, for
the intention of the obligation of contracts clause, as the evidence
amply shows, was to protect private executory contracts, and especially
contracts of debt. ¹ In actual practice, on the other hand, the decision
produced one considerable benefit: in the words of a contemporary
critic, it put private institutions of learning and charity out of the
reach of ""legislative despotism and party violence."" ¹ Much of the evidence is readily traceable through the Index to Max
Farrand's Records of the Federal

 Convention."|('74478 Steele Squares Suite 293\nMaryview, NH 01049', 'PSC 5147, Box 6315\nAPO AE 15711')
"But doubtless, the critic will urge, by the same sign this decision also
put profit-seeking corporations beyond wholesome legislative control. But is this a fact? To begin with, such a criticism is clearly
misdirected. As we have just seen, the New Hampshire Superior Court
itself would have felt that Fletcher vs. Peck left it no option
669 Martin Garden
Lake Annafurt, MN 30060
 but to
declare the amending act void, had Dartmouth College been, say, a gas
company; and this was in all probability the universal view of bench and
bar in 1819. Whatever blame there is should therefore be awarded the
earlier decision. But, in the second place, there does not appear after
all to be so great measure of blame to be awarded. The opinion in
Dartmouth College vs. Woodward leaves it perfectly clear that
legislatures may reserve the right to alter or repeal at will the
charters they grant. If therefore alterations and repeals have not been
as frequent as public policy has demanded, whose fault is it? Perhaps, however, it will be argued that the real mischief of the
decision has consisted in its effect upon the state Legislatures
themselves, the idea being that large business interests, when offered
the opportunity of obtaining irrepealable charters, have frequently
found it worth their while to assail frail legislative virtue with
irresistible temptation. The answer to this charge is a ""confession in
avoidance""; the facts alleged are true enough but hardly to the
5709 Alvarez Drive
New Clayton, MT 04460
 point."|('669 Martin Garden\nLake Annafurt, MN 30060', '5709 Alvarez Drive\nNew Clayton, MT 04460')
"Yet even if they were, what is to be said of that other not uncommon
incident
675 Sara Fall Apt. 240
Powellchester, SC 85654
 of legislative history, the legislative ""strike,"" whereby
corporations not protected by irrepealable charters are blandly
confronted with the alternative of having their franchises mutilated or
of paying handsomely for their immunity? So the issue seems to resolve
itself into a question of taste regarding two species of legislative
""honesty."" Does one prefer that species which, in the words of the late
Speaker Reed, manifests itself in ""staying bought,"" or that species
which flowers in legislative blackmail? The truth of the matter is that
Marshall's decision has been condemned by ill-informed or
ill-intentioned critics for evils which are much more simply and much
more adequately explained by general human cupidity and by the power
inherent in capital. These are evils which have been experienced quite
as fully in other countries which never heard of the ""obligation of
contracts"" clause. The decisions reached in Fletcher vs. Peck and Dartmouth College vs.
Woodward are important episodes in a significant phase of American
constitutional history. Partly on account of the lack of distinction
between legislative and judicial power and
82106 Jenkins Mill
Hoffmanshire, MT 23908
 partly on account of the
influence of the notion of parliamentary sovereignty, legislative bodies
at the close of the eighteenth century were the sources of much
anonymous and corporate despotism. Even in England as well as in this
country the value, and indeed the possibility, of representative
institutions had been frankly challenged in the name of liberty. For the
United States the problem of making legislative power livable and
tolerable--a problem made the more acute by the multiplicity of
legislative bodies--was partly solved by the establishment of judicial
review. But this was only the first step: legislative power had still to
be defined and

 confined."|('675 Sara Fall Apt. 240\nPowellchester, SC 85654', '82106 Jenkins Mill\nHoffmanshire, MT 23908', '70231 Williams Plains Suite 261\nKristenstad, MD 42354')
"Marshall's audacity in invoking generally
recognized moral principles against legislative sovereignty in his
interpretation of the ""obligation of contracts"" clause pointed the way
to the American judiciaries for the discharge of their task of defining
legislative power. The final result is to be seen today in the Supreme
Court's concept of the police power of a State as a power not of
arbitrary but of reasonable legislation. While Marshall was performing this service in behalf of representative
government, he was also aiding the cause of nationalism by accustoming
certain types of property to look upon the National Government as their
natural champion against the power of the States. In this connection it
should also be recalled that Gibbons vs. Ogden and Brown vs. Maryland
had advanced the principle of the exclusiveness of Congress's power over
foreign and interstate commerce. Under the shelter of this
interpretation there developed, in the railroad and transportation
business of the country before the Civil War, a property interest almost
as
26343 Ashley Unions Apt. 932
South Kathryn, NV 89149
 extensive as that which supported the doctrine of State Rights. Nor
can it be well doubted that Marshall designed some such result or that
he aimed to prompt the reflection voiced by King of Massachusetts on the
floor of the Federal Convention. ""He was filled with astonishment that,
if we were convinced that every man in America was secured in all his
rights, we should be ready to sacrifice this substantial good to the
phantom of state sovereignty."" Lastly, these decisions brought a certain theoretical support to the
Union. Marshall himself did not regard the Constitution as a compact
between the States; if a compact at all, it was a compact among
individuals, a social compact. But a great and increasing number of his
countrymen took the other

 view."|('26343 Ashley Unions Apt. 932\nSouth Kathryn, NV 89149', '49955 Bradley Camp\nJonathanview, AZ 65957')
"How unsafe, then, it would have been
from the standpoint of one concerned for the integrity of the Union, to
distinguish public contracts from private on the ground that the former,
in the view of the Constitution,
511 Serrano Highway

 had less obligation! CHAPTER VII

The Menace Of State Rights

Marshall's reading of the Constitution may be summarized in a phrase: it
transfixed State Sovereignty with a two-edged sword, one edge of which
was inscribed ""National Supremacy,"" and the other ""Private Rights."" Yet
State Sovereignty, ever reanimated by the democratic impulse of the
times, remained a serpent which was scotched but not killed. To be sure,
this dangerous enemy to national unity had failed to secure for the
state Legislatures the right to interpret the Constitution with
authoritative finality; but its argumentative resources were still far
from exhausted, and its political resources were steadily increasing. It
was still capable of making a notable resistance even in withdrawing
itself, until it paused in its recoil and flung itself forward in a new
attack. The connecting link between the Supreme Court and the state courts has
already been pointed out to be Section XXV of the Act of 1789 organizing
the Federal Judiciary. ¹ This section provides, in effect, that when a
suit is brought in a state court under a state law, and the party
against whom it is brought claims some right under a national law or
treaty or under
959 Paul Lane
Kirkshire, AL 00950
 the Constitution itself, the highest state court into
which the case can come must either sustain such a claim or consent to
have its decision reviewed, and possibly reversed, by the Supreme Court. The defenders of State Rights at first applauded this arrangement
because it left to the local courts the privilege of sharing a
jurisdiction which could have been claimed exclusively by the Federal
Courts. But when State Rights began to grow into State Sovereignty, a
different attitude developed, and in 1814 the Virginia Court of Appeals,
in the case of Hunter vs. Martin, ² pronounced Section XXV void, though,
in order not to encourage the disloyal tendencies then rampant in New
England, the decision was not published until after the Treaty of Ghent,
in February, 1815. ¹ See pages 14-15."|('511 Serrano Highway\nNew Audreyfort, IN 83580', '959 Paul Lane\nKirkshire, AL 00950')
"² 4 Munford (Va.), 1. See also William E. Dodd's article on Chief
Justice Marshall and Virginia in American Historical Review, vol. XII,
p. 776. The head and front of the
13083 Mark Junctions Apt. 911
Tylerside, HI 18672
 Virginia court at this time was Spencer Roane,
described as ""the most powerful politician in the State,"" an ardent
Jeffersonian, and an enemy of Marshall on his own account, for had
Ellsworth not resigned so inopportunely, late in 1800, and had Jefferson
had the appointment of his successor, Roane would have been the man. His
opinion in Hunter vs. Martin disclosed personal animus in every line and
was written with a vehemence which was more likely to discomfit a
grammarian than its designed victims; but it was withal a highly
ingenious plea. At one point Roane enjoyed an advantage which would not
be his today when so much more gets into print, for the testimony of
Madison's Journal, which was not published till 1840, is flatly against
him on the main issue. In 1814, however, the most nearly contemporaneous
evidence as to the intention
PSC 0956, Box 6653
APO AA 64165
 of the framers of the Constitution was that
of the Federalist, which Roane stigmatizes as ""a mere newspaper
publication written in the heat and fury of the battle,"" largely by ""a
supposed favorer of a consolidated government."" This description not
only overlooks the obvious effort of the authors of the Federalist to
allay the apprehensions of state jealousy but it also conveniently
ignores Madison's part in its composition. Indeed, the enfant terrible
of State Rights, the Madison of 1787-88, Roane would fain conceal behind
the Madison of ten years later; and the Virginia Resolutions of 1798
and the Report of 1799 he regards the earliest ""just exposition of the
principles of the Constitution."" To the question whether the Constitution gave ""any power to the Supreme
Court of the United States to reverse the judgment of the supreme court
of a State,"" Roane returned an emphatic negative."|('13083 Mark Junctions Apt. 911\nTylerside, HI 18672', 'PSC 0956, Box 6653\nAPO AA 64165')
"His argument may be
summarized thus: The language of Article III of the Constitution does
not regard the state courts as composing a part of the judicial
organization of the General Government; and the States, being sovereign,
cannot be stripped of their power merely by implication. Conversely, the
General Government is a government over individuals and is therefore
expected to exercise its powers solely through its own organs. To be
sure, the judicial power of the United States extends to ""all cases
arising"" under the Constitution and the laws of the United States. But
in
5192 Walsh Port
New Barbara, MI 96512
 order to come within this description, a case must not merely involve
the construction of the Constitution or laws of the United States; it
must have been instituted in the United States courts, and not in those
of another Government. Further, the Constitution and the acts of
Congress ""in pursuance thereof"" are ""the supreme law of the land,"" and
""the judges in every State"" are ""bound thereby, anything in the
Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding."" But
they are bound as state judges and only as such; and what the
Constitution is, or what acts of Congress are ""in pursuance"" of it, is
for them to declare without any correction or interference by the courts
of another jurisdiction. Indeed, it is through the power of its courts
to say finally what acts of Congress are constitutional and what are
not, that the State is able to exercise its right of arresting within
its boundaries unconstitutional measures of the General Government. For
the legislative nullification of such measures proposed by the Virginia
and Kentucky resolutions is thus substituted judicial nullification by
the local judiciaries. In Martin vs. Hunter's Lessee, ¹ which was decided in February, 1816,
Story, speaking for the Court, undertook to answer Roane. Roane's major
premise he met with flat denial: ""It is a mistake,"" he asserts, ""that
the Constitution was not designed to operate upon States in their
corporate
752 Russell Junctions

 capacities."|('5192 Walsh Port\nNew Barbara, MI 96512', '752 Russell Junctions\nWest Nancy, NE 27869')
"It is crowded with provisions which restrain or
annul the sovereignty of the States in some of the highest branches of
their prerogatives."" The greater part of the opinion, however,
349 Burke Flat Suite 342
Deanfort, MT 61808
 consisted
of a minute examination of the language of Article III of the
Constitution. In brief, he pointed out that while Congress ""may ...
establish"" inferior courts and, therefore, may not, it was made
imperative that the judicial power of the United States ""shall extend to
all cases arising ... under"" the Constitution and acts of Congress. If,
therefore, Congress should exercise its option and not establish
inferior courts, in what manner, he asked, could the purpose of the
Constitution be realized except by providing appeals from the state
courts to the United States Supreme Court? But more than that, the
practical consequences of the position taken by the Virginia Court of
Appeals effectually refuted it. That there should be as many versions of
the Constitution, laws, and treaties as there are States in the Union
was certainly never intended by the framers, nor yet that plaintiffs
alone should say when resort should be had to the national tribunals,
which were designed for the benefit of all. ¹ 1 Wheaton, 304. Marshall had an indirect interest in the case. See
supra, pp. If Story's argument is defective at any point, it is in its failure to
lay down a clear definition of ""cases arising under this Constitution,""
and this defect in constitutional interpretation is supplied five years
later in Marshall's opinion in Cohens vs.

Port Antoniochester, AZ 40806
 Virginia."|('349 Burke Flat Suite 342\nDeanfort, MT 61808', '625 Pugh Oval Suite 193\nPort Antoniochester, AZ 40806')
"¹ The facts of this
famous case were as follows: Congress had established a lottery for the
District of Columbia, for which the Cohens had sold tickets in Virginia. They had thus run foul of a state law prohibiting such transactions
18930 William Square
Lauriemouth, MO 53914
 and
had been convicted of the offense in the Court of Quarterly Sessions of
Norfolk County and fined one hundred dollars. From this judgment they
were now appealing under Section XXV. ¹ 6 Wheaton, 264. Counsel for the State of Virginia again advanced the principles which
had been developed by Roane in Hunter vs. Martin but urged in addition
that this particular appeal rendered Virginia a defendant contrary to
Article XI of the Amendments. Marshall's summary of their argument at
the outset of his opinion is characteristic: ""They maintain,"" he said,
""that the nation does not possess a department capable of restraining
peaceably, and by authority of law, any attempts which may be made by a
part against the legitimate powers of the whole, and that the government
is reduced to the alternative of submitting to such attempts or of
resisting them by force. They maintain that the Constitution of the
United States has provided no tribunal for the final construction of
itself or of the laws or treaties of the nation, but that this power
must be exercised in the last resort by the courts of every State in the
Union. That the Constitution, laws, and treaties may receive as many
constructions as there are States; and that this is not a mischief, or,
if a mischief, is irremediable."" The cause of such absurdities, Marshall continued, was a conception of
State Sovereignty contradicted by the very words of the Constitution,
which assert its supremacy, and that of all acts of Congress in
pursuance of it, over all conflicting state laws whatsoever. ""This,"" he
proceeded to say, ""is the authoritative language of the American People,
and if gentlemen please, of the American States."|('18930 William Square\nLauriemouth, MO 53914',)
"It marks, with lines
too
95302 Richards Forge Suite 263
Fitzgeraldfort, AR 00832
 strong to be mistaken, the characteristic distinction between the
Government of the Union and those of the States. The General Government,
though limited as to its objects, is supreme with respect to those
objects. This principle is a part of the Constitution, and if there be
any who deny its necessity, none can deny its authority."" Nor was this
to say that the Constitution is unalterable. ""The people make the
Constitution, and the people can unmake it. It is the creature of their
own will, and lives only by their will. But this supreme and
irresistible power to make or unmake resides only in the whole body of
the people, not in any subdivision of them. The attempt of any of the
parts to exercise it is usurpation, and ought to be repelled by those to
whom the people have delegated their power of repelling it."" Once Marshall had swept aside the irrelevant notion of State
Sovereignty, he proceeded with the remainder of his argument without
difficulty. Counsel for Virginia had contended that ""a case arising
under the Constitution or a law must be one in which a party comes into
court to demand something conferred on him by the Constitution or a
law""; but this construction Marshall held to be ""too

law or equity consists of the right of the one party as well as of the
other, and may truly be said to arise under the Constitution or a law of
the United States whenever its correct decision depends on the
construction of either.""

Lake Stephanie, DC 62198
 From this it followed that Section XXV was a
measure necessary and proper for extending the judicial power of the
United States appellately to such cases whenever they were first brought
in a state court. Nor did Article XI of the Amendments nullify the power
thus conferred upon the Court in a case which the State itself had
instituted, for in such a case the appeal taken to the national tribunal
was only another stage in an action ""begun and prosecuted,"" not against
the State, but by the State. The contention of Virginia was based upon
the assumption that the Federal and the State Judiciaries constituted
independent systems for the enforcement of the Constitution, the
national laws, and treaties, and such an assumption Marshall held to be
erroneous. For the purposes of the Constitution the United States ""form
a single nation,"" and in effecting these purposes the Government of the
Union may ""legitimately control all individuals or governments within
the American territory."" ""Our opinion in the Bank Case,"" Marshall had written Story from Richmond
in 1819, a few weeks after M'Culloch vs. Maryland, ""has roused the
sleeping spirit of Virginia, if indeed it ever sleeps."" Cohens vs.
Virginia, in 1821, produced an even more decided reaction. Jefferson,
now in retirement, had long since nursed his antipathy for the Federal
Judiciary to the point of monomania. It was in his eyes ""a subtle corps
of sappers and miners constantly working underground to undermine our
confederated fabric""; and this latest assault upon the rights of the
States seemed to him, though perpetrated in the usual way, the most
outrageous of all: ""An opinion is huddled up in conclave, perhaps by a
majority of one, delivered as if unanimous, and with the silent
acquiescence of lazy or timid associates, by a crafty chief judge, who
sophisticates the law to his own mind by the turn of his own reasoning."" Roane, Jefferson's protégé, was still more violent and wrote a series of
unrestrained papers at this time in the Richmond Enquirer, under the
pseudonym ""Algernon Sidney."""|('19101 Davila Plaza Apt. 658\nLake Stephanie, DC 62198',)
"Alluding to

 these, Marshall wrote Story
that ""their coarseness and malignity would designate the author of them
if he was not avowed."" Marshall himself thought to answer Roane, but
quickly learned that the Virginia press was closed to that side of the
question. He got his revenge, however, by obtaining the exclusion of
Roane's effusions from Hall's Law Journal, an influential legal
periodical published in Philadelphia. But the personal aspect of the
controversy was the least important. ""A deep design,"" Marshall again
wrote his colleague, ""to convert our Government into a mere league of
States has taken hold of a powerful and violent party in Virginia. The
attack upon the judiciary is in fact an attack upon the Union."" Nor was
Virginia the only State where this movement was formidable, and an early
effort to repeal Section XXV was to be anticipated. That the antijudicial movement was extending to other States was indeed
apparent. The decision in Sturges vs. Crowinshield ¹ left for several
years the impression that the States could not pass bankruptcy laws even
for future contracts and consequently afforded a widespread grievance. Ohio had defied the ruling in M'Culloch vs. Maryland, and her Treasurer

"Kentucky had a still sharper grievance in the decision in Green vs.
Biddle, ² which invalidated a policy she had been pursuing for nearly a
quarter of a century with reference to squatters' holdings; and what
made the decision seem the more outrageous was the mistaken belief that
it had represented the views of only a minority of the justices. ¹ 4 Wheaton, 122. ² 8 Wheaton, 1. The Legislatures of the aggrieved States were soon in full hue and cry
at the heels of the Court; and from them the agitation quickly spread to
Congress. ¹ On December 12, 1821, Senator Johnson of Kentucky proposed
an amendment to the Constitution which was intended to substitute the
Senate for the Supreme Court in all constitutional cases. In his
elaborate speech in support of his proposition, Johnson criticized at
length the various decisions of the Court but especially those grounded
on its interpretation of the ""obligation of contracts"" clause. More than
that, however, he denied in toto the rights of the Federal Courts to
pass upon the constitutionality either of acts of Congress or of state
legislative measures. So long as judges were confined to the field of
jurisprudence, the principles of which were established and immutable,
judicial independence was all very well, said Johnson, but ""the science
of politics was still in its infancy""; and in a republican system of
government its development should be entrusted to those organs which
were responsible to the people. Judges were of no better clay than other
folk. ""Why, then,"" he asked, ""should they be considered any more
infallible, or their decisions any less subject to investigation and
revision?"""|()
"Furthermore, ""courts, like cities, and villages, or like
legislative bodies, will sometimes have their leaders; and it may happen
that a single individual will be the prime cause of a decision to
overturn the deliberate act of a whole State or of the United States;
yet we are admonished to receive their opinions as the ancients did the
responses of the Delphic oracle, or the Jews, with more propriety, the
communications from Heaven delivered by Urim and Thummim to the High
Priest of God's chosen people."" ¹ For a good review of the contemporary agitation aroused by Marshall's
decisions, see two articles by Charles Warren in the American Law
Review, vol. For several years after this, hardly a session of Congress convened in
which there was not introduced some measure for the purpose either of
curbing the Supreme Court or of curtailing Marshall's influence on its
decisions. One measure, for example, proposed the repeal of Section XXV;
another, the enlargement of the Court from seven to ten judges; another,
the requirement that any decision setting aside a state law must have
the concurrence of five out of seven judges; another, the allowance of
appeals to the Court on decisions adverse to the constitutionality of
state laws as well as on decisions sustaining them. Finally, in January,
1826, a bill enlarging the Court to ten judges passed the House by a
vote of 132 to 27. In the Senate, Rowan of Kentucky moved an amendment
requiring in all cases the concurrence of seven of the proposed ten
judges. In a speech which was typical of current criticism of the Court
he bitterly assailed the judges for the protection they had given the
Bank--that ""political juggernaut,"" that ""creature of the perverted
corporate powers of the Federal Government""--and he described the Court
itself as ""placed above the control of the will of the people, in a
state of disconnection with them, inaccessible to the charities and
sympathies of human life."" The amendment failed, however, and in the end
the bill itself was rejected. Yet a proposition to swamp the Court which received the approval of
four-fifths of the House of Representatives cannot be lightly dismissed
as an aberration. Was it due to a fortuitous coalescence of local
grievances, or was there a general underlying

"That Marshall's
principles of constitutional law did not entirely accord with the
political and economic life of the nation at this period
6451 Gabrielle Burg
Lake Danielview, LA 63067
 must be
admitted. The Chief Justice was at once behind his times and ahead of
them. On the one hand, he was behind his times because he failed to
appreciate adequately the fact that freedom was necessary to frontier
communities in meeting their peculiar problems--a freedom which the
doctrine of State Rights promised them--and so he had roused Kentucky's
wrath by the pedantic and, as the Court itself was presently forced to
admit, unworkable decision in Green vs. Biddle. Then on the other hand,
the nationalism of this period was of that negative kind which was
better content to worship the Constitution than to make a really
serviceable application of the national powers. After the War of 1812
the great and growing task which confronted the rapidly expanding nation
was that of providing adequate transportation,
20586 Carpenter Crossing
West Shaneport, OK 06547
 and had the old
federalism from which Marshall derived his doctrines been at the helm,
this task would undoubtedly have been taken over by the National
Government. By Madison's veto of the Cumberland Road Bill, however, in
1816, this enterprise was handed over to the States; and they eagerly
seized upon it after the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 and the
perception of the immense success of the venture. Later, to be sure, the
panic of 1837 transferred the work of railroad and canal building to the
hands of private capital but, after all, without altering greatly the
constitutional problem. For with corporations to be chartered, endowed
with the power of eminent domain, and adequately regulated, local policy
obviously called for widest latitude. Reformers are likely to count it a grievance that the courts do not trip
over themselves in an endeavor to keep abreast with what is called
""progress."" But the true function of courts is not to reform, but to
maintain a definite status

"The Constitution defined a status quo
the fundamental principles of
15998 Vazquez Mall Apt. 917
Guystad, MS 44282
 which Marshall considered sacred. At the
same time, even his obstinate loyalty to ""the intentions of the framers""
was not impervious to facts nor unwilling to come to terms with them,
and a growing number of his associates were ready to go considerably
farther. While the agitation in Congress against the Court was at its height,
Marshall handed down his decision in Gibbons vs. Ogden, and shortly
after, that in Osborn vs. United States Bank. ¹ In the latter case,
which was initiated by the Bank, the plaintiff in error, who was
Treasurer of the State of Ohio, brought forward Article XI of the
Amendments to the Constitution as a bar to the action, but Marshall held
that this Amendment did not prevent a state officer from being sued for
acts done in excess of his rightful powers. He also reiterated and
amplified the principles of M'Culloch vs. Maryland. Three years later he
gave his opinions in Brown vs. Maryland and Ogden vs. Saunders. ² In the
former Marshall's opinion was dissented from by a single associate, but
in the latter the Chief Justice found himself for the first and only
time in his entire incumbency in the rôle of dissenter in a
constitutional case. The decision of the majority, speaking through
Justice Washington, laid down the principle that the obligation of a
private executory contract cannot be said to be ""impaired"" in a
constitutional sense by the adverse effect of legislative acts
antedating the making of the contract; and thus the dangerous ambiguity
of Sturges vs. Crowinshield was finally resolved in favor of the States. ¹ 9 Wheaton, 738. ² 12 Wheaton, 213."|('15998 Vazquez Mall Apt. 917\nGuystad, MS 44282',)
"In the course of the next few years the Court, speaking usually through
the Chief Justice, decided several cases on principles favoring local
interest, sometimes indeed curtailing the operation of previously
established principles. For example, the Court held that, in the absence
of specific legislation by Congress to the contrary, a State may erect a
dam across navigable waters of the United States for local purposes ¹;
that the mere grant of a charter to a corporation does not prevent the
State from taxing such corporation on its franchises, notwithstanding
that ""the power to tax
698 Joyce Forks Suite 727
Carlosstad, KY 60602
 involves the power to destroy"" ²; that the
Federal Courts have no right to set a state enactment aside on the
ground that it had divested vested rights, unless it had done so through
impairing the obligation of contracts ³; that the first eight Amendments
to the Constitution do not limit state power, but only Federal power 4;
that decisions adverse to state laws must have the concurrence of a
majority of the Court. 5

times, Marshall found his last years to be among the most trying of his
chief justiceship. Jackson, who was now President, felt himself the
chosen organ of ""the People's will"" and was not disposed to regard as
binding anybody's interpretation of the Constitution except his own. The
West and Southwest, the pocket boroughs of the new Administration, were
now deep in land speculation and clamorous for financial expedients
which the Constitution banned."|('698 Joyce Forks Suite 727\nCarlosstad, KY 60602', '7967 Diana Mountains\nJohnfort, IA 41812')
"John Taylor of Caroline had just finished
his task of defining the principles of constitutional construction which
were requisite to convert the Union into a league of States and had laid
his work at the feet of Calhoun. Taylor was a candid man and frankly
owned the historical difficulties in the way of carrying out his
purpose; but Calhoun's less scrupulous dialectic swept aside every
obstacle that stood in the way of attributing to the States the
completest sovereignty.

 In Craig vs. Missouri (1830) ¹ the Court was confronted with a case in
which a State had sought to evade the prohibition of the Constitution
against the emission of bills of credit by establishing loan offices
with authority to issue loan certificates intended to circulate
generally in dimensions of fifty cents to ten dollars and to be
receivable for taxes. A plainer violation of the Constitution would be
difficult to imagine. Yet Marshall's decision setting aside the act was
followed by a renewed effort to procure the repeal of Section XXV of the
Judiciary Act. The discussion of the proposal threw into interesting
contrast two points of view. The opponents of this section insisted upon
regarding constitutional cases as controversies between the United
States and the States in their corporate capacities; its advocates, on
the other hand, treated the section as an indispensable safeguard of
private rights. In the end, the latter point of view prevailed: the bill
to repeal, which had come up in the House, was rejected by a vote of 138
to 51, and of the latter number all but six came from Southern States,
and more than half of them from natives of Virginia. ¹ 4 Peters, 410. Meantime the Supreme Court had become involved in controversy with
Georgia on account of a series of acts which that State had passed
extending its jurisdiction over the Cherokee Indians in violation of the
national treaties with this tribe."|('281 Herrera Street Apt. 163\nDebbieville, WY 44212',)
"In Corn Tassel's case, the appellant
from the Georgia court to the United States Supreme Court was hanged in
defiance of a writ of error from the Court. In Cherokee Nation vs.
Georgia, the Court itself held that it had no jurisdiction. Finally, in
1832, in Worcester vs. Georgia, ¹ the Court was confronted squarely with
the question of the validity of the Georgia acts. The State put in no
appearance, the acts were pronounced void, and the decision went
unenforced. When Jackson was asked what effort the Executive Department
would make to back up the Court's mandate, he is reported to have said:
""John Marshall has made his decision; now let him enforce it."" ¹ 6 Peters, 515. Marshall began to see the Constitution and the Union crumbling before
him. ""I yield slowly and reluctantly to the conviction,"" he wrote Story,
late in 1832, ""that our Constitution cannot last.... Our opinions [in
the South] are incompatible with a united government even among
ourselves. The Union has been prolonged this far by miracles."" A
personal consideration sharpened his

guarantee of the character of the person who was to succeed him. At
first he thought of remaining until after the election of 1832; but
Jackson's reëlection made him relinquish altogether the idea of
resignation. A few months later, in consequence of the Administration's vigorous
measures against nullification

Erintown, MT 37308
 in South Carolina, things were
temporarily wearing a brighter aspect. Yet that the fundamental elements
of the situation had been thereby altered, Marshall did not believe. ""To
men who think as you and I do,"" he wrote Story, toward the end of 1834,
""the present is gloomy enough; and the future presents no cheering
prospect. In the South ... those who support the Executive do not
support the Government. They sustain the personal power of the
President, but labor incessantly to impair the legitimate powers of the
Government. Those who oppose the rash and violent measures of the
Executive ... are generally the bitter enemies of Constitutional
Government. Many of them are the avowed advocates of a league; and those
who do not go the whole length, go a great part of the way. What can we
hope for in such
492 Herrera Stravenue

 circumstances?"""|('1889 Robert Way Apt. 703\nPort Natalieview, OH 69127', '07446 Erik Fall\nErintown, MT 37308', '492 Herrera Stravenue\nAnneland, ME 67718')
"Yet there was one respect in which the significance of Marshall's
achievement must have been as clear to himself as it was to his
contemporaries. He had failed for the time being to establish his
definition of national power, it is true, but he had made the Supreme
Court one of the great political forces of the country. The very
ferocity with which the pretensions of the Court were assailed in
certain quarters was indirect proof of its power, but there was also
direct testimony of a high order. In 1830 Alexis de Tocqueville, the
French statesman, visited the United States just as the rough frontier
democracy was coming into its own. Only through the Supreme Court, in
his opinion, were the forces of renewal and growth thus liberated to be
kept within the bounds set by existing institutions. ""The peace, the
prosperity, and the very existence of the Union,"" he wrote, ""are vested
in the hands of the seven Federal judges. Without them the Constitution
would be a dead letter: the Executive appeals to them for assistance
against the encroachments of the legislative power; the Legislature
demands their protection against the assaults of the Executive; they
defend the Union from the disobedience of the States, the States from
the exaggerated claims of the Union, the public interest against private
interests and the conservative spirit of stability against the
fickleness of the democracy."" The contrast between these observations
and the disheartened words in which Jay declined renomination to the
chief justiceship in 1801 gives perhaps a fair measure of Marshall's
accomplishment. Of the implications of the accomplishment of the great Chief Justice for
the political life of the country, let De Tocqueville speak again:
""Scarcely any political question arises in the United States which is
not resolved sooner, or later, into a judicial question. Hence all
parties are obliged to borrow in their daily controversies the ideas,
and even the language peculiar to judicial
PSC 7108, Box 5709
APO AE 17670
 proceedings...."|('PSC 7108, Box 5709\nAPO AE 17670',)
"The language
of the law thus becomes, in some measure, a vulgar tongue; the spirit of
law, which is produced in the schools and courts of justice, gradually
penetrates beyond their walls into the bosom of society, where it
descends to the lowest classes, so that at last the whole people
contract the habits and the tastes of the judicial magistrate."" In one respect, however, De Tocqueville erred. American ""legalism,"" that
curious infusion of politics with jurisprudence, that mutual
consultation of public opinion and established principles, which in the
past has so characterized the course of discussion and legislation in
America, is traceable to origins long antedating Marshall's chief
justiceship. On the other hand, there is no public career in American
history which ever built so largely upon this pervasive trait of the
national outlook as did Marshall's, or which has contributed so much to
render it effective in palpable institutions. CHAPTER VIII

Among Friends And Neighbors

It is a circumstance of no little importance that the founder of
American Constitutional Law was in tastes and habit of life a simple
countryman. To the establishment of National Supremacy and the
9813 Frank Rue
East Matthew, CO 28396
 Sanctity
of Contracts Marshall brought the support not only of his office and his
command of the art of judicial reasoning but also the whole-souled
democracy and unpretentiousness of the fields. And it must be borne in
mind that Marshall was on view before his contemporaries as a private
citizen rather more of the time, perhaps, than as Chief Justice. His
official career was, in truth, a somewhat leisurely one. Until 1827 the
term at Washington rarely lasted over six weeks and subsequently not
over ten weeks. In the course of his thirty-four years on the Bench, the
Court handed down opinions in over 1100 cases, which is probably about
four times the number of opinions now handed down at a single term; and
of this number Marshall spoke for the Court in about half the
30065 Day Square
Tracymouth, MT 44215
 cases."|('9813 Frank Rue\nEast Matthew, CO 28396', '30065 Day Square\nTracymouth, MT 44215')
"Toward the middle of March, he left Washington for Richmond, and on the
22d of May opened court in his own circuit. Then, three weeks later, if
the docket permitted, he went on to Raleigh to hold court there for a
few days. The summers he usually spent on the estate which he inherited
from his father at Fauquier, or else he went higher up into the
mountains to escape
44697 Wilson View
Rickeyberg, CT 42608
 malaria. But by the 22d of November at the latest he
was back once more in Richmond for court, and at the end of December for
a second brief term he again drove to Raleigh in his high-wheeled
563 William Run Suite 765
Cruzbury, WY 78691
 gig. With his return to Washington early in February he completed the round
of his judicial year. The entire lack of pageantry and circumstance which attended these
journeyings of his is nowhere more gaily revealed than in the following
letter to his wife, which is now published for the first time through
the kindness of Mr. Beveridge:

Rawleigh, Jan.y 2d, 1803. My dearest Polly

You will laugh at my vexation when you hear the various calamities that
have befallen me. In the first place when I came to review my funds, I
had the mortification to discover that I had lost 15 silver dollars out
of my waist coat pocket. They had worn through the various mendings the
pocket had sustained and sought their liberty in the sands of Carolina. I determined not to vex myself with what could not be remedied & ordered
Peter to take out my cloaths that I might dress for court when to my
astonishment & grief after fumbling several minutes in the portmanteau,
starting [sic] at vacancy, & sweating most profusely he turned to me
with the doleful tidings that I had no pair of

"You may be sure
this piece of intelligence was not very graciously received; however,
after a little scolding, I determined to make the best of my situation &
immediately set out to get a pair made. I thought I should be a sans-culotte only one day & that for the residue
of the term I might be well enough
31067 Tyler Club
Lake Kevinfort, WV 77989
 dressed for the appearance on the
first day to be forgotten. But, the greatest of evils, I found, was followed by still greater. Not
a taylor in town could be prevailed on to work for me. They were all so
busy that it was impossible to attend to my wants however pressing they
might be, & I have the extreme mortification to pass the whole time
without that important article of dress I have mentioned. I have no
alleviation for this misfortune but the hope that I shall be enabled in
four or five days to commence my journey homeward & that I shall have
the pleasure of seeing you & our dear children in eight or nine days
after this reaches you. In the meantime, I flatter myself that you are well and happy. Adieu my dearest Polly
I am your own affectionate,
J. Marshall. Marshall erected his Richmond home, called ""Shockoe Hill,"" in 1793 on a
plot of ground which he had purchased four years earlier. Here, as his
eulogist has said, was ""the scene of his real
9880 Bradley Isle Suite 970

 triumphs."""|('31067 Tyler Club\nLake Kevinfort, WV 77989', '9880 Bradley Isle Suite 970\nWilsonmouth, CT 54183')
"At an early
date his wife became a nervous invalid, and his devotion to her brought
out all the finest qualities of his sound and tender nature. ""It is,""
says Mr. Beveridge, ""the most marked characteristic of his entire
private
353 Vazquez Port Apt. 438
Port Patricktown, IA 27294
 life and is the one thing which differentiates him sharply from
the most eminent men of that heroic but socially free-and-easy period."" From his association with his wife Marshall derived, moreover, an
opinion of the sex ""as the friends, the companions, and the equals of
man"" which may be said to have furnished one of his few points of
sympathetic contact with American
PSC 0379, Box 9053
APO AP 72945
 political radicalism in his later
years. The satirist of woman, says Story, ""found no sympathy in his
bosom,"" and ""he was still farther above the commonplace flatteries by
which frivolity seeks to administer aliment to personal vanity, or vice
to make its approaches for baser purposes. He spoke to the sex when
present, as he spoke of them when absent, in language of just appeal to
their understandings, their tastes, and their duties."" Marshall's relations with his neighbors were the happiest possible. Every week, when his judicial duties permitted or the more ""laborious
relaxation"" of directing his farm did not call him away, he attended the
meetings of the Barbecue Club in a fine grove just outside the city, to
indulge in his favorite diversion of quoits. The Club consisted of
thirty of the most prominent men of Richmond, judges, lawyers, doctors,
clergymen, and merchants. To quoits was added the inducement of an
excellent repast of which roast pig was the pièce de résistance. Then
followed a dessert of fruit and melons, while throughout a generous
stock of porter, toddy, and of punch ""from which water was carefully
excluded,"" was always available to relieve thirst."|('353 Vazquez Port Apt. 438\nPort Patricktown, IA 27294', 'PSC 0379, Box 9053\nAPO AP 72945')
"An entertaining
account of a meeting of the Club at which Marshall and his friend
Wickham were the caterers has been thus preserved for us:

At the table Marshall announced that at the last meeting two members had
introduced politics,
20363 Misty Ridge Suite 916
East Courtney, CA 76694
 a forbidden subject, and had been fined a basket of
champagne, and that this was now produced, as a warning to evil-doers;
as the club seldom drank this article, they had no champagne glasses,
and must drink it in tumblers. Those who played quoits retired after a
while for a game. Most of the members had smooth, highly polished brass
quoits. But Marshall's were large, rough, heavy, and of iron, such as
few of the members could throw well from hub to hub. Marshall himself
threw them with great success and accuracy, and often ""rang the meg."" On
this occasion Marshall and the Rev. Mr. Blair led the two parties of
players. Marshall played first, and rang the meg. Parson Blair did the
same, and his quoit came down plumply on top of Marshall's. There was
uproarious applause, which drew out all the others from the dinner; and
then came an animated controversy as to what should be the effect of
this exploit."|('20363 Misty Ridge Suite 916\nEast Courtney, CA 76694',)
"They all returned to the table, had another bottle of
champagne, and listened to arguments, one from Marshall, pro se, and one
from Wickham for Parson Blair. [Marshall's] argument is a humorous
companion piece to any one of his elaborate judicial opinions. He began
by formulating the question, ""Who is winner when the adversary quoits
are on the meg at the same time?"" He then stated the facts, and remarked
that the question was one of the true construction and applications of
the rules of the game. The first one ringing the meg has the advantage. No other can succeed
77519 Steven Glen
Erinbury, RI 01556
 who does not begin by displacing this first one. The parson, he willingly allowed, deserves to rise higher and higher in
everybody's esteem; but then he mustn't do it by getting on another's
back in this fashion. That is more like leapfrog than quoits. Then,
again, the legal maxim, Cujus est solum, ejus est usque ad cœlum--his
own right as first occupant extends to the vault of heaven; no opponent
can gain any advantage by squatting on his back. He must either bring a
writ of ejectment, or drive him out vi et
366 Angela Alley

 armis."|('77519 Steven Glen\nErinbury, RI 01556', '366 Angela Alley\nJoshuashire, CT 29473')
"And then, after further
argument of the same sort, he asked judgment, and sat down amidst great
applause.
4390 Stephanie Mount
Stoneside, KY 02409
 Mr. Wickham then rose, and made an argument of a similar pattern. No
rule, he said, requires an impossibility. Mr. Marshall's quoit is twice
as large as any other; and yet it flies from his arm like the iron ball
at the Grecian games from the arm of Ajax. It is impossible for an
ordinary quoit to move it. With much more of the same sort, he contended
that it was a drawn game. After very animated voting, designed to keep
up the uncertainty as long as possible, it was so decided. Another trial
was had, and Marshall clearly won. B. Thayer, John Marshall (Riverside Biographical Series, 1904), pp. 134-36, paraphrasing G. W. Munford, The Two Parsons (Richmond,

"Years later Chester Harding, who once painted Marshall, visited the
Club. ""I watched,"" says he, ""for the coming of the old chief. He soon
approached, with his coat on his arm and his hat in his hand, which he
was using as a fan. He walked
2053 Jamie Station
Greenstad, OK 09387
 directly up to a large bowl of mint julep
which had been prepared, and drank off a tumblerful, smacking his lips,
and then turned to the company with a cheerful 'How are you, gentlemen?' He was looked upon as the best pitcher of the party and could throw
heavier quoits than any other member of the club. The game began with
great animation. There were several ties; and before long I saw the
great Chief Justice of the United States down on his knees measuring the
contested distance with a straw, with as much earnestness as if it had
been a point of law; and if he proved to be in the right, the woods
would ring with his triumphant shout."" ¹ What Wellesley remarked of the
younger Pitt may be repeated of Marshall, that ""unconscious of his
superiority,"" he ""plunged heedlessly into the mirth of the hour"" and was
endowed with ""a gay heart and social spirit beyond any man of his time."" ¹ Thayer, op. As a hero of anecdotes Marshall almost rivals

"Many of the tales
preserved are doubtless apocryphal, but this qualification hardly
lessens their value as contemporary impressions of his character and
habits. They show for what sort of anecdotes his familiarly known
personality had an affinity.
649 Carrie Dale

 The Chief Justice's entire freedom from ostentation and the gentleness
with which he could rebuke it in others is illustrated in a story often
told. Going early to the
414 David Fords Suite 165
Traviston, ID 47361
 market one morning he came upon a youth who was
fuming and swearing because he could get no one to carry his turkey home
for him. Marshall proffered his services. Arriving at the house the
young man asked, ""What shall I pay you?"" ""Oh, nothing,"" was the reply;
""it was on my way, and no trouble."" As Marshall walked away, the young
man inquired of a bystander, ""Who is that polite old man that brought
home my turkey for me?"" ""That,"" was the answer, ""is Judge Marshall,
Chief Justice of the United States."" Of the same general character is an anecdote which has to do with a much
earlier period when Marshall was still a practicing
18439 Graham Roads Apt. 101
Bryantberg, AK 96545
 attorney."|('649 Carrie Dale\nChoiborough, OR 69515', '414 David Fords Suite 165\nTraviston, ID 47361', '18439 Graham Roads Apt. 101\nBryantberg, AK 96545')
"An old
farmer who was involved in a lawsuit came to Richmond to attend its
trial. ""Who is the best lawyer in Richmond?"" he asked of his host, the
innkeeper of the Eagle tavern. The latter pointed to a tall, ungainly,
bareheaded man who had just passed, eating cherries from his hat and
exchanging jests with other loiterers like himself. ""That is he,"" said
the innkeeper; ""John Marshall is his name."" But the old countryman, who
had a hundred dollars in his pocket, proposed to spend it on something
more showy and employed a solemn, black-coated, and much powdered
bigwig. The latter turned out in due course to be a splendid
illustration of the proverb that ""fine feathers do not make fine birds."" This the crestfallen rustic soon discovered. Meantime he had listened
with amazement and growing admiration to an argument by Marshall in a
cause which came on before his own. He now went up to Marshall and,
explaining his difficulty, offered him the five dollars which the
exactions of the first attorney still left him, and besought his aid."|()
"With a humorous remark about the power of a black coat and powdered wig
Marshall good-naturedly accepted the retainer. The religious bent of the Chief Justice's mind is illustrated in another
story, which tells of his arriving toward the close of day at an inn in
one of the counties of Virginia, and falling in with some young men who
presently
7796 Parker Harbors Apt. 850
North Katherinechester, GA 92029
 began ardently to debate the question of the truth or falsity
of the Christian religion. From six until eleven o'clock the young
theologians argued keenly and ably on both sides of the question. Finally one of the bolder spirits exclaimed that it was impossible to
overcome prejudices of long standing and, turning to the silent visitor,
asked: ""Well, my old gentleman, what do you think of these things?"" To
their amazement the ""old gentleman"" replied for an hour in an eloquent
and convincing defense of the Christian religion, in which he answered
in order every objection the young men had uttered. So impressive was
the simplicity and loftiness of his discourse that the erstwhile critics
were completely silenced. In truth, Marshall's was a reverent mind, and it sprang instinctively to
the defense of ideas and institutions whose value had been tested. Unfortunately, in his Life of Washington Marshall seems to have given
this propensity a somewhat undue scope. There were external difficulties
in dealing with such a subject apart from those inherent in a great
biography, and Marshall's volumes proved to be a general disappointment. Still hard pressed for funds wherewith to meet his Fairfax investment,
he undertook this work shortly after he became Chief Justice, at the
urgent solicitation of Judge Bushrod Washington, the literary executor
of his famous
31552 Kane Forest Apt. 869

 uncle."|('7796 Parker Harbors Apt. 850\nNorth Katherinechester, GA 92029', '31552 Kane Forest Apt. 869\nDennisfort, MA 27567')
"Marshall had hoped to make this incursion into the
field of letters a very remunerative one, for he and Washington had
counted on some thirty thousand subscribers for the work. The publishers
however, succeeded in obtaining only about a quarter of that number,
owing partly at least to the fact that Jefferson had no sooner learned
of the enterprise than his jealous mind conceived the idea that
46971 Miles Passage Suite 110
Carrollmouth, MO 03598
 the
biography must be intended for partisan purposes. He accordingly gave
the alarm to the Republican press and forbade the Federal postmasters to
take orders for the book. At the same time he asked his friend Joel
Barlow, then residing in Paris, to prepare a counterblast, for which he
declared himself to be ""rich in materials."" The author of the Columbiad,
however, declined this hazardous commission, possibly because he was
unwilling to stand sponsor for the malicious recitals that afterwards
saw light in the pages of the Anas. But apart from this external opposition to the biography, Marshall found
a source of even keener disappointment in the literary
1992 Rush Rest
Tammystad, WV 57324
 defects due to
the haste with which he had done his work. The first three volumes had
appeared in 1804, the fourth in 1805, and the fifth, which is much the
best, in 1807. Republican critics dwelt with no light hand upon the
deficiencies of these volumes, and Marshall himself sadly owned that the
""inelegancies"" in the first were astonishingly numerous. But the
shortcomings of the work as a satisfactory biography are more notable
than its lapses in diction. By a design apparently meant to rival the
improvisations of Tristram Shandy, the birth of the hero is postponed
for an entire volume, in which the author traces the settlement of the
country."|('46971 Miles Passage Suite 110\nCarrollmouth, MO 03598', '1992 Rush Rest\nTammystad, WV 57324')
"At the opening of the second volume ""the birth of young Mr.
Washington"" is gravely announced, to be followed by an account of the
Father of his Country so devoid of intimate touches that it might easily
have been written by one who had never seen
6415 Michael Fort
South Chrismouth, NE 98167
 George Washington. Nevertheless, these pages of Marshall's do not lack acute historical
judgments. He points out, for instance, that, if the Revolution had
ended before the Articles of Confederation were adopted, permanent
disunion might have ensued and that, faulty as it was, the Confederation
""preserved the idea of Union until the good sense of the Nation adopted
a more efficient system."" Again, in his account of the events leading up
to the Convention of 1787, Marshall rightly emphasizes facts which
subsequent writers have generally passed by with hardly any mention, so
that students may read this work with profit even

 today. But the chief
importance of these volumes lay, after all, in the additional power
which the author himself derived from the labor of their preparation. In
so extensive an undertaking Marshall received valuable training for his
later task of laying the foundations of Constitutional Law in America. One of his chief assets on the bench, as we have already seen, was his
complete confidence in his own knowledge of the intentions of the
Constitution--a confidence which was grounded in the consciousness that
he had written the history of the Constitution's framing. Most of Marshall's correspondence, which is not voluminous, deals with
politics or legal matters. But there are letters in which the personal
side of the Chief Justice is revealed. He gives his friend Story a
touching account of the loss of two of his

remarks, ""are not lofty, she does not soar on eagle's wings, but she is

Port Mary, ID 37038
 his scientific work had
deprived him of all liking for poetry. The following letter, which Marshall wrote the year before his death to
his grandson, a lad of fourteen or fifteen, is interesting for its views
on a variety of subjects and is especially pleasing for its
characteristic freedom from condescension:

I had yesterday the pleasure of receiving your letter of the 29th of
November, and am quite pleased with the course of study you are
pursuing. Proficiency in Greek and Latin is indispensable to an
accomplished scholar, and may be of great real advantage in our progress
through human life. Cicero deserves to be studied still more for his
talents than for the improvement in language to be derived from reading
him. He was unquestionably, with the single exception of Demosthenes,
the greatest orator among the ancients. He was too a

 History is among the most essential departments of knowledge; and, to an
American, the histories of England and of the United States are most
instructive. Every man ought to be intimately acquainted with the
history of his own country. Those of England and of the United States
are so closely connected that the former seems to be introductory to the
latter. They form one whole. Hume, as far as he goes, to the revolution
of 1688, is generally thought the best Historian of England. Others have
continued his narrative to a late period, and it will be necessary to
read them also. There is no exercise of the mind from which more valuable improvement is
to be drawn than from composition. In every situation of life the result
of early practice will be valuable. Both in speaking and writing, the
early habit of arranging our thoughts with regularity, so as to point
them to the object to be proved, will be of great

"In both,
clearness and precision are most essential qualities. The man who

constitutes good writing. The meaning ought never to be mistaken. Indeed
the readers should never be obliged to search for it. The writer should
always express himself so clearly as to make it impossible to
misunderstand him. He should be comprehended without an effort. The first step towards writing and speaking clearly is to think clearly. Let the subject be perfectly understood, and a man will soon find words
to convey his meaning to others. Blair, whose lectures are greatly and
justly admired, advises a practice well worthy of being observed. It is
to take a page of some approved writer and read it over repeatedly until
the matter, not the words, be fully impressed on the

"Its residence is the human heart, and its inseparable companion
is a quiet conscience. Of this, Religion is the surest and safest
foundation. The individual who turns his thoughts frequently to an
omnipotent omniscient and all perfect being, who feels his dependence
on, and his infinite obligations to that being will avoid that course of
life which must harrow up the conscience. Marshall was usually most scrupulous to steer clear of partisan politics
both in his letters and in his conversation,
Unit 9863 Box 9451
DPO AP 98372
 so that on one occasion he
was much aroused by a newspaper article which had represented him ""as
using language which could be uttered only by an angry party man."" But
on political issues of a broader nature he expressed himself freely in
the strict privacy of correspondence at least, and sometimes identified
himself with public movements, especially in his home State. For
instance, he favored the gradual abolition of slavery by private
emancipation rather than by governmental action. In 1823 he became first
president of the Richmond branch of the Colonization Society; five years
later he presided over a convention to promote internal improvements in
Virginia; and in 1829 he took a prominent part in the deliberations of
the State Constitutional Convention. In the broader matters of national concern his political creed was in
thorough agreement with his constitutional doctrine. Nullification he
denounced as ""wicked folly,"" and he warmly applauded Jackson's
proclamation of warning to South Carolina. But Marshall regarded with
dismay Jackson's aggrandizement of the executive branch, and the one
adverse criticism he has left of the Constitution is of the method
provided for the election of the
77268 Thomas Ways Apt. 683

 President."|('Unit 9863 Box 9451\nDPO AP 98372', '77268 Thomas Ways Apt. 683\nSnowville, SC 78506')
"In this connection he wrote
in 1830: ""My own private mind has been slowly and reluctantly advancing
to the belief that the present mode of choosing the Chief Magistrate
threatens the most serious danger to the public happiness. The passions
of men are influenced to so fearful an extent, large masses are so
embittered against each other, that I dread the consequences.... Age is,
perhaps, unreasonably timid. Certain it is that I now dread consequences
that
36664 Smith Isle
Port Deannastad, VA 59628
 I once thought imaginary. I feel disposed to take refuge under some
less turbulent and less dangerous mode of choosing the Chief
Magistrate."" Then follows the suggestion that the people of the United
States elect a body of persons equal in number to one-third of the
Senate and that the President be chosen from among this body by lot. Marshall's suggestion seems absurd enough today, but it should be
remembered that his fears of national disorder as a result of strong
party feeling at the time of presidential elections
2184 Rebecca Tunnel
Lake Scott, AK 66169
 were thoroughly
realized in 1860 when Lincoln's election led to secession and civil war,
and that sixteen years later, in the Hayes-Tilden contest, a second
dangerous crisis was narrowly averted. In the campaign of 1832 Marshall espoused privately the cause of Clay
and the United States Bank, and could not see why Virginia should not be
of the same opinion. Writing to Story in the midst of the campaign he
said: ""We are up to the chin in politics. Virginia was always insane
enough to be opposed to the Bank of the United States, and therefore
hurrahs for the veto. But we are a little doubtful how it may work

"It is not difficult to account for the part New York may
take. She has sagacity enough to see her interests in putting down the
present Bank. Her mercantile position gives her a control, a commanding
control, over the currency and the exchanges
36870 Stephanie Village
Royland, IA 34728
 of the country, if there be
no Bank of the United States. Going for herself she may approve this
policy; but Virginia ought not to drudge for her."" To the end of his
days Marshall seems to have refused to recognize that the South had a
sectional interest to protect, or at least that Virginia's interests
were sectional; her attachment to State Rights he assigned to the
baneful influence of Jeffersonianism. The year 1831 dealt Marshall two severe blows. In that year his robust
constitution manifested the first signs of impairment, and he was forced
to undergo an operation for stone. In the days before anæsthetics, such
an operation, especially in the case of a person of his advanced years,
was attended with great peril. He faced the ordeal with the utmost
composure. His physician tells of visiting Marshall the morning he was
to submit to the knife and of finding him at breakfast:

He received me with a pleasant smile ... and said, ""Well, Doctor, you
find me taking breakfast, and I assure you I have had a good
079 Park Ports

 one."|('36870 Stephanie Village\nRoyland, IA 34728', '079 Park Ports\nMitchellburgh, TN 62002')
"I
thought it very probable that this might be my last chance, and
therefore I was determined to enjoy it and eat heartily."" He said
that he had not the slightest desire to live, laboring under the
sufferings to which he was subjected, and that he was perfectly ready to
take all the chances of an operation, and he knew there were many
against him.... After he had finished his breakfast, I administered him
some medicine; he then inquired at what hour the operation would be
performed. I mentioned the hour of eleven. He said ""Very well; do you
wish me for any other purpose, or may I lie down and go to sleep?"" I was
a good deal surprised at this question, but told him that if he could
sleep it would be very desirable. He immediately placed himself upon the
bed and fell into a
785 Shannon Points Apt. 939
Lake Tyler, ME 57671
 profound sleep, and continued so until I was obliged
to rouse him in order to undergo the operation. He exhibited the same
fortitude, scarcely uttering a murmur throughout the whole procedure
which, from the nature of his complaint, was necessarily tedious. The death of his wife on Christmas Day of the same year was a heavy
blow. Despite her invalidism, she was a woman of much force of character
and many graces of mind, to which Marshall rendered touching tribute in
a quaint eulogy composed for one of his sons on the first anniversary of
her death:

Her judgment was so sound and so safe that I have often relied upon it
in situations of some perplexity.... Though serious as well as gentle in
her deportment, she possessed a good deal of chaste, delicate, and
playful wit, and if she permitted herself to indulge this talent, told
her little story with grace, and could mimic very successfully the
peculiarities of the person who was its subject."|('785 Shannon Points Apt. 939\nLake Tyler, ME 57671',)
"She had a fine taste
for belle-lettre reading.... This quality, by improving her talents for
conversation, contributed not inconsiderably to make her a most
desirable and agreeable companion. It beguiled many of those winter
evenings during which her protracted ill health and her feeble nervous
system confined us entirely to each other. I shall never cease to look
back on them with deep interest and regret.... She felt deeply the
distress of others, and indulged the feeling liberally on objects she
believed to be meritorious.... She was a firm believer in the faith
inculcated by the Church in which she was bred, but her soft and gentle
temper was incapable of adopting the gloomy and austere dogmas which
some of its professors have sought to engraft on it. Marshall believed women were the intellectual equals of men, because he
was convinced that they possessed in a high degree ""those qualities
which make up the sum of human happiness and transform the domestic
fireside into an elysium,"" and not because he thought they could compete
on even terms in the usual activities of men. Despite these ""buffetings of fate,"" the Chief Justice was back in
Washington in attendance upon Court in February, 1832, and daily walked
several miles to and from the Capitol. In the following January his
health appeared to be completely restored. ""He seemed,"" says Story, with
whom he messed, along with Justices Thompson and Duval, ""to revive, and
enjoy anew his green old age."" This year Marshall had the gratification
of receiving the tribute of Story's magnificent dedication of his
Commentaries to him. With characteristic modesty, the aged Chief Justice
expressed the fear that his admirer had ""consulted a partial friendship
farther than your deliberate judgment will approve."""|()
"He was especially
interested in the copy intended for the schools, but he felt that ""south
of the Potomac, where it is most wanted it will be least used,"" for, he
continued, ""it is a Mohammedan
7003 Eric Row Apt. 275
Lake Kelly, AR 80034
 rule never to dispute with the ignorant,
and we of the true faith in the South adjure the contamination of
infidel political works. It would give our orthodox nullifyer a fever to
read the heresies of your Commentaries. A whole school might be infected
by the atmosphere of a single copy should it be placed on one of the
shelves of a bookcase."" Marshall sat on the Bench for the last time in the January term of 1835. Miss Harriet Martineau, who was in Washington during that winter, has
left a striking picture of the Chief Justice as he appeared in these
last days. ""How delighted,"" she writes, ""we were to see Judge Story
bring in the tall, majestic, bright-eyed old man,--old by chronology, by
the lines on his composed face, and by his services to the republic; but
so dignified, so fresh, so present to the time, that no compassionate
consideration for age dared mix with the contemplation
89610 Christy Dale
Smithchester, SC 15104
 of him."" Marshall was, however, a very sick man, suffering constant pain from a
badly diseased liver. The ailment was greatly aggravated, moreover, by
""severe contusions"" which he received while returning in the stage from
Washington to Richmond. In June he went a second time to Philadelphia
for medical assistance, but his case was soon seen to be hopeless. He
awaited death with his usual serenity, and two days before it came he
composed the modest epitaph which appeared upon his tomb: John Marshall,
son of Thomas and Mary Marshall, was born on the 24th of September,
1755, Intermarried with Mary Willis Ambler the 3d of January, 1783,

"He died the evening of July
6, 1835, surrounded by three of his sons. The death of the fourth, from
an accident while he was hurrying to his father's bedside, had been kept
from him. He left also a daughter and numerous grandchildren. Marshall's will is dated April 9, 1832, and has five codicils of
subsequent dates attached. After certain donations to grandsons named
John and Thomas, the estate, consisting chiefly of his portion of the
Fairfax purchase, was to be divided equally among his five children. To
the daughter and her descendants were also secured one hundred shares of
stock which his wife had held in the Bank of the United States, but in
1835 these were probably of little value. His faithful body servant
Robin was to be emancipated and, if he chose, sent
24794 Campbell Grove Apt. 790
North Karlamouth, ND 17119
 to Liberia, in which
event he should receive one hundred dollars. But if he preferred to
remain in the Commonwealth, he should receive but fifty dollars; and if
it turned out to ""be impracticable to liberate him consistently with law
and his own inclination,"" he was to select his master from among the
children, ""that he may always be treated as a faithful meritorious
servant."" The Chief Justice's death evoked many eloquent tributes to his public
services and private excellencies, but none more just and appreciative
than that of the officers of court and members of the bar of his own
circuit who knew him most intimately. It reads as follows:

John Marshall, late Chief Justice of the United States, having departed
this life since the last Term of the Federal Circuit Court for this
district, the Bench, Bar, and Officers of the Court, assembled at the
present Term, embrace the first opportunity to express their profound
and heartfelt respect for the memory of the venerable judge, who
presided in this Court for thirty-five years--with such remarkable
diligence in office, that, until he was disabled by the disease which
removed him from life, he was never known to be absent from the bench,
during term time, even for a day,--with such indulgence to counsel and
suitors, that every body's convenience was consulted, but his own,--with
a dignity, sustained without effort, and, apparently, without care to
sustain it, to which all men were solicitous to pay due respect,--with
such profound sagacity, such quick penetration, such acuteness,
clearness, strength, and comprehension of mind, that in his hand, the
most complicated causes were plain, the weightiest and most difficult,
easy and light,--with such striking impartiality and justice, and a
judgment so sure, as to inspire universal confidence, so that few
appeals were ever taken from his decisions, during his long
administration of justice in the Court, and those only in cases where he
himself expressed doubt,--with such modesty, that he seemed wholly
unconscious of his own gigantic powers,--with such equanimity, such
benignity of temper, such amenity of manners, that not only none of the
judges, who sat with him on the bench, but no member of the bar, no
officer of the court, no juror, no witness, no suitor, in a single
instance, ever found or imagined, in any thing said or done, or omitted
by him, the slightest cause of

 offence."|('24794 Campbell Grove Apt. 790\nNorth Karlamouth, ND 17119', '4499 Moon Point Suite 621\nLake Kennethmouth, MT 87887')
"His private life was worthy of the exalted character he sustained in
public station. The unaffected simplicity of his manners; the spotless
purity of his morals; his social, gentle, cheerful disposition; his
habitual self-denial, and boundless generosity towards others; the
strength
3361 Barker Union Apt. 224

 and constancy of his attachments; his kindness to his friends
and neighbours; his exemplary conduct in the relations of son, brother,
husband, father; his numerous charities; his benevolence towards all
men, and his ever active beneficence; these amiable qualities shone so
conspicuously in him, throughout his life, that, highly as he was
respected, he had the rare happiness to be yet more beloved. There is no more engaging figure in American history, none more entirely
free from disfiguring idiosyncrasy, than the son of Thomas Marshall. CHAPTER IX

Epilogue

In the brief period of twenty-seven months following the death of
Marshall the Supreme Court received a new Chief Justice and five new
Associate Justices. The effect of this change in personnel upon the
doctrine of the Court soon became manifest. In the eleventh volume of
Peters's Reports, the first issued while Roger B. Taney was Chief
Justice, are three decisions of constitutional cases sustaining state
laws which on earlier argument Marshall had assessed as
unconstitutional. The first of these decisions gave what was designated
""the complete, unqualified, and exclusive"" power of the State to
regulate its ""internal police"" the right of way over the ""commerce
clause"" ¹; the second practically nullified the constitutional
prohibition against ""bills of credit"" in deference to the same high
prerogative ²; the third curtailed the operation of the ""obligation of
contracts"" clause as a protection of public grants. ³ Story, voicing ""an
earnest desire to vindicate his [Marshall's] memory from the imputation
of rashness,"" filed passionate and unavailing dissents. With difficulty
he was dissuaded from resigning from a tribunal whose days of influence
he thought gone by. 4 During the same year Justice Henry Baldwin,
another of Marshall's friends and associates, published his View of the
Constitution, in which he rendered high praise to the departed Chief
Justice's qualifications as expounder of the
178 Friedman Run Apt. 577

 Constitution."|('3361 Barker Union Apt. 224\nWest David, WV 73584', '178 Friedman Run Apt. 577\nWest Sharon, WI 06485')
"""No

made a commentary more accordant with its strict intention and
language.... He never brought into action the powers of his mighty mind

compatriots,"" he was himself the historian of its framing, wherefore, as
its expositor, ""he knew its objects, its intentions."" Yet in the
8668 Johnson Mount Apt. 807
Camposborough, NE 19032
 face of
these admissions, Baldwin rejects Marshall's theory of the origin of the
Constitution and the corollary doctrine of liberal construction. ""The
history and spirit of the times,"" he wrote, ""admonish us that new
versions of the Constitution will be promulgated to meet the varying
course of political events or aspirations of power."" ¹ Milton vs. New York, 11 Peters, 102. ² Briscoe vs. Bank of Kentucky, 11 Peters, 257. ³ Charles River Bridge Company vs. Warren Bridge Company, 11 Peters,

in our day, be any case in which a law of a State or of Congress will be
declared unconstitutional; for the old constitutional doctrines are fast
fading away."" Life and Letters of Joseph Story,

"II, p. 272; see
also p. 270, for Chancellor Kent's unfavorable reaction
172 Warner Stravenue
New Saraland, NE 45521
 to these
decisions. But the radical impulse soon spent itself. Chief Justice Taney himself
was a good deal of a conservative. While he regarded the Supreme Court
rather as an umpire between two sovereignties than as an organ of the
National Government for the vigorous assertion of its powers, which was
Marshall's point of view, Taney was not at all disposed to disturb the
law as it had been declared by his predecessor in binding decisions. Then, too, the development of railroading and the beginning of
immigration from Europe on a large scale reawakened the interest of a
great part of the nation in keeping intercourse between the States
untrammeled by local selfishness; and in 1851 the Court, heeding the
spirit of compromise of the day, decisively accepted for the most
important category of cases Marshall's principle of the exclusive
control of interstate and foreign commerce by Congress. ¹

¹ Cooley vs. the Board of Wardens, 12 Howard, 299. Still, until the eve of the Civil War, the theory of the Constitution
held by the great body of the people, North as well as South, was that
it was a compact of States. Then in December, 1860, South Carolina
announced her secession from the Union. Buchanan's message of the same
month performed the twofold service of refuting secession on State
Rights principles and of demonstrating, albeit unwittingly, how
impossible it was practically to combat the movement on the same
principles. Lincoln brought the North back to Marshall's position when
he remarked in his Inaugural Address: ""Continue to execute all the
express provisions of our National Constitution, and the Union will
endure
91322 Robert Way Suite 326

 forever."""|('172 Warner Stravenue\nNew Saraland, NE 45521', '91322 Robert Way Suite 326\nDavisland, NE 23021')
"The Civil War has been characterized as ""an appeal from the judgments of
Marshall to the arbitrament
2147 Peterson Courts
West Jill, MI 20709
 of war."" Its outcome restored the concept of
the National Government as a territorial sovereign, present within the
States by the superior mandate of the American People, and entitled to
""execute on every foot of American soil the powers and functions that
belong to it."" ¹ These powers and functions are, moreover, today
undergoing constant enlargement. No one now doubts that in any clash
between national and state power it is national power which is entitled
to be defined first, and few persons question that it ought to be
defined in the light of Marshall's principle, that a Constitution
designed for ages to come must be ""adapted to the various crises of
human affairs."" ¹ Justice Bradley in ex parte Siebold, 100 U. S., 371. It is only when we turn to that branch of Constitutional Law which
defines governmental power in relation to private rights that we lose
touch with Marshall's principles. As we have seen, he dealt in
absolutes: either power was given to an unlimited extent or it was
withheld altogether. Today, however, the dominant rule in this field of
Constitutional Law is the ""rule of reason."" In the last analysis, there
are few private rights which are not subordinate to the general welfare;
but, on the other hand, legislation which affects private rights must
have a reasonable tendency to promote the general welfare and must not
arbitrarily invade the rights of particular persons or classes. Inasmuch
as the hard and fast rules of an age when conditions of life were
simpler are no longer practicable under the more complex relationships
of modern times, there is today an inevitable tendency to force these
rules to greater
PSC 9210, Box 3081
APO AE 13277
 flexibility."|('2147 Peterson Courts\nWest Jill, MI 20709', 'PSC 9210, Box 3081\nAPO AE 13277')
"¹

¹ Notwithstanding what is said above, it is also true that the modern
doctrine of ""the police power"" owes something to Marshall's
interpretation of the ""necessary and proper"" clause in M'Culloch vs.
Maryland, which is frequently offered nowadays as stating the
authoritative
275 Patterson Lake Apt. 191
New Olivia, WI 25380
 definition of ""a fair legislative discretion"" in relation
to private rights. Indeed this ingenious transposition was first
suggested in Marshall's day. See Cowen (N. But it never
received his sanction and does not represent his point of view. And this difference in the point of view of the judiciary connotes a
general difference of outlook which makes itself felt today even in that
field where Marshall wrought most enduringly. The Constitution was
established under the sway of the idea of the balance of power, and with
the purpose of effecting a compromise among a variety of more or less
antagonistic interests, some of which were identified with the cause of
local autonomy, others of which coalesced with the cause of National
Supremacy. The Nation and the States were regarded as competitive
forces, and a condition of tension between them was thought to be not
only normal but desirable. The modern point of view is very different. Local differences have to a great extent disappeared, and that general
interest which is the same for all the States is an ever deepening one. The idea of the competition of the States with the Nation is yielding to
that of their coöperation in public service. And it is much the same
with the relation of the three departments of
Unit 6769 Box 2849
DPO AE 07565
 Government."|('275 Patterson Lake Apt. 191\nNew Olivia, WI 25380', 'Unit 6769 Box 2849\nDPO AE 07565')
"The notion
that they have antagonistic interests to guard is giving way to the
perception of a general interest
798 Michelle Tunnel Suite 265
South Elizabethside, ND 21126
 guarded by all according to their
several faculties. In brief, whereas it was the original effort of the
Constitution to preserve a somewhat complex set of values by nice
differentiations of power, the present tendency, born of a surer vision
of a single national welfare, is toward the participation of all powers
in a joint effort for a common end. But though Marshall's work has been superseded at many points, there is
no fame among American statesmen more strongly bulwarked by great and
still vital institutions. Marshall established judicial review; he
imparted to an ancient legal tradition a new significance; he made his
Court one of the great political forces of the country; he founded
American Constitutional Law; he formulated, more tellingly than any one
else and for a people whose thought was permeated with legalism, the
principles on which the integrity and ordered growth of their Nation
have depended. Springing from the twin rootage of Magna Charta and the
Declaration of Independence, his judicial statesmanship finds no
parallel in the salient features of its achievement outside our own
annals. BIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE

All accounts of Marshall's career previous to his appointment as Chief
Justice have been superseded by Albert J. Beveridge's two admirable
volumes, The Life of John Marshall (Boston, 1916). The author paints on
a large canvas and with notable skill. His work is history as well as
biography. His ample plan enables him to quote liberally from Marshall's
writings and from all the really valuable first-hand sources. Both text
and notes are valuable repositories of material."|('798 Michelle Tunnel Suite 265\nSouth Elizabethside, ND 21126',)
"Beveridge has
substantially completed a third volume covering the first decade of
Marshall's chief-justiceship, and the entire work will probably run to
five volumes. Briefer accounts
694 Dixon Village
Michaelville, AR 25645
 of Marshall covering his entire career will be found in
Henry Flanders's Lives and Times of the Chief Justices of the Supreme
Court (1875) and Van Santvoord's Sketches of the Lives, Times, and
Judicial Services of the Chief Justices of the Supreme Court (1882). Two
excellent brief sketches are J. B. Thayer's John Marshall (1901) in the
Riverside Biographical Series, and W. D. Lewis's essay in the second
volume of The Great American Lawyers, 8 vols. (Philadelphia, 1907), of
which he is also the editor. The latter is particularly happy in its
blend of the personal and legal, the biographical and critical. B.
Magruder's John Marshall (1898) in the American Statesman Series falls
considerably below the general standard maintained by that excellent
series. The centennial anniversary of Marshall's accession to the Supreme Bench
was generally observed by Bench and Bar throughout the United States,
and many of the addresses on the great Chief Justice's life and judicial
services delivered by distinguished judges and lawyers on that occasion
were later collected by John F. Dillon and published in John Marshall,
Life, Character, and Judicial Services, 3 vols. (Chicago, 1903). In
volume XIII of the Green Bag will be found a skillfully constructed
mosaic biography of Marshall drawn from these

 addresses."|('694 Dixon Village\nMichaelville, AR 25645', 'PSC 8972, Box 8617\nAPO AA 98000')
"The most considerable group of Marshall's letters yet published are
those to Justice Story, which will be found in the Massachusetts
Historical Society Proceedings, Second Series, volume XIV, pp. These and most of the Chief Justice's other letters which have thus far
seen the light of day will be found in J. E. Oster's Political and
Economic
2295 Lawrence Flats Suite 916
Lake Alexander, ME 52553
 Doctrines of John Marshall (New York, 1914). Here also will be
found a copy of Marshall's will, of the autobiography which he prepared
in 1818 for Delaplaine's Repository but which was never published there,
and of his eulogy of his wife. The two principal sources of Marshall's
anecdotes are the Southern Literary Messenger, volume II, p. 181 ff.,
and Henry Howe's Historical Collections of Virginia (Charleston, 1845). Approaching the value of sources are Joseph Story's Discourse upon the
Life, Character, and Services of the Hon. John Marshall (1835) and
Horace Binney's Eulogy (1835), both of which were pronounced by personal
friends shortly after Marshall's death and both of which are now
available in volume III of Dillon's compilation, cited above. The value
of Marshall's Life of Washington as bearing on the origin of his own
point of view in politics was noted in the text (Chapter VIII). Marshall's great constitutional decisions are, of course, accessible in
the Reports, but they have also been assembled into a single volume by
John M. Dillon, John Marshall; Complete Constitutional Decisions
(Chicago, 1903), and into two instructively edited volumes by Joseph P.
Cotton, Constitutional Decisions of John Marshall (New York, 1905). Story's famous Commentaries on the Constitution gives a systematic
presentation of Marshall's constitutional doctrines, which is fortified
at all points by historical reference; the second edition is the best. For other contemporary evaluations of Marshall's decisions, often
hostile, see early volumes of the North American Review and Niles's
Register; also the volumes of the famous John Taylor of Caroline."|('2295 Lawrence Flats Suite 916\nLake Alexander, ME 52553',)
"A
brief general account of later date of the decisions is to be found in
the Constitutional History of the United States as Seen in the
Development of American Law (New York, 1889), a course of lectures
before the Political Science Association of the University of Michigan. Detailed commentary of a high order of scholarship is furnished by
Walter Malins Rose's Notes to the Lawyers' Edition of the United States
Reports, 13 vols. The more valuable
060 Kimberly Drive
Michellehaven, NE 03266
 of Marshall's decisions
on circuit are collected in J. W. Brockenbrough's two volumes of Reports
of Cases Decided by the Hon. John Marshall (Philadelphia, 1837), and his
rulings at Burr's Trial are to be found in Robertson's Reports of the
Trials of Colonel Aaron Burr, 2 vols. Marshall's associates on the Supreme Bench are pleasingly sketched in
Hampton L. Carson's Supreme Court of the United States (Philadelphia,
1891), which also gives many interesting facts bearing on the history of
the Court itself. In the same connection Charles Warren's History of the
American Bar (Boston, 1911) is also valuable both for the facts which it
records and for the guidance it affords to further material. Of
biographies of contemporaries and coworkers of Marshall, the most
valuable are John P. Kennedy's Memoirs of the Life of William Wirt, 2
vols. (Philadelphia, 1860); William Wetmore Story's Life and Letters of
Joseph Story, 2 vols. (Boston, 1851); and William Kent's Memoirs and
Letters of James Kent (Boston, 1898). Everett P. Wheeler's Daniel
Webster the Expounder of the Constitution (1905) is instructive, but
claims far too much for Webster's influence upon Marshall's

 the formative hand in shaping our Constitutional Law. The vast amount of material brought together in Gustavus Myers's History
of the Supreme Court (Chicago, 1912) is based on purely ex parte
statements and is so poorly authenticated as to be valueless. He writes
from the socialistic point of view and fluctuates between the desire to
establish the dogma of ""class bias"" by a coldly impartial examination of
the ""facts"" and the desire to start a scandal reflecting on individual
reputations. The literature of eulogy and appreciation is, for all practical
purposes, exhausted in Dillon's collection. But a reference should be

Transcriber's Notes


Introduction:

The Chronicles of America Series has two similar editions of each volume
in the series. One version is the Abraham Lincoln edition of the series,
a premium version which includes full-page pictures. A textbook edition
was also produced, which does not contain the pictures and captions
associated with the pictures, but is otherwise the same book. This book
was produced to match the textbook edition of the book. We have retained the original punctuation and spelling in the book, but
there are a few exceptions. Obvious errors were corrected--and all of
these changes can be found in the Detailed Notes Section of these
10588 Thomas Prairie
Guzmanmouth, WI 12267
 notes."|('10588 Thomas Prairie\nGuzmanmouth, WI 12267',)
"The Detailed Notes Section also includes issues that have come up during
transcription. One common issue is that words are sometimes split into
two lines for spacing purposes in the original text. These words are
hyphenated in the physical book, but there is a question sometimes as to
whether
9755 Megan Pass
South David, TN 99048
 the hyphen should be retained in transcription. The reasons
behind some of these decisions are itemized. We place footnotes after the paragraph in which they are referenced. The
footnote may appear on a different page number in this e-book as
compared
9904 Kelly Rapid
Lake Jessicaside, PA 21961
 to the paper book. For example, the footnote with Nereide
appears on page 118 in the paper book, but on page 119 in this e-book. For some index entries with notes, the reference may appear on the page
following the one mentioned in the index. Detailed Notes Section:

On Page 27, health-giving was hyphenated between two lines for spacing
and could be transcribed as healthgiving. We retained the hyphen in
transcribing the word."|('9755 Megan Pass\nSouth David, TN 99048', '9904 Kelly Rapid\nLake Jessicaside, PA 21961')
"On Page 55, elbow-room was hyphenated between two lines for spacing and
could be transcribed as elbowroom. We retained the hyphen in
transcribing the word. On Page 87, rendez-vous was hyphenated between two lines for spacing and
could be transcribed as rendezvous. In this case, the latter option took
preference: ""He also made the island both a convenient rendezvous for
his adherents ...""

On Page 208, add missing period after uncle to conclude the clause ""the
literary executor of his famous uncle."" On Page 220, add missing period after hopeless to conclude the clause
""but his case was soon seen to be hopeless."" *** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK JOHN MARSHALL AND THE

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of
equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with
the IRS. The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
